    "title": "The Role of ChatGPT in Data Science: How AI-Assisted Conversational Interfaces Are Revolutionizing the Field",
    "abstract": "ChatGPT, a conversational AI interface that utilizes natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, is taking the world by storm and is the buzzword across many sectors today. Given the likely impact of this model on data science, through this perspective article, we seek to provide an overview of the potential opportunities and challenges associated with using ChatGPT in data science, provide readers with a snapshot of its advantages, and stimulate interest in its use for data science projects. The paper discusses how ChatGPT can assist data scientists in automating various aspects of their workflow, including data cleaning and preprocessing, model training, and result interpretation. It also highlights how ChatGPT has the potential to provide new insights and improve decision-making processes by analyzing unstructured data. We then examine the advantages of ChatGPT\u2019s architecture, including its ability to be fine-tuned for a wide range of language-related tasks and generate synthetic data. Limitations and issues are also addressed, particularly around concerns about bias and plagiarism when using ChatGPT. Overall, the paper concludes that the benefits outweigh the costs and ChatGPT has the potential to greatly enhance the productivity and accuracy of data science workflows and is likely to become an increasingly important tool for intelligence augmentation in the field of data science. ChatGPT can assist with a wide range of natural language processing tasks in data science, including language translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification. However, while ChatGPT can save time and resources compared to training a model from scratch, and can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, it may not perform well on certain tasks if it has not been specifically trained for them. Additionally, the output of ChatGPT may be difficult to interpret, which could pose challenges for decision-making in data science applications.",

    "abstract": "The R programming language is approaching its 30th birthday, and in the last three decades it has achieved a prominent role in statistics, bioinformatics, and data science in general. It currently ranks among the top 10 most popular languages worldwide, and its community has produced tens of thousands of extensions and packages, with scopes ranging from machine learning to transcriptome data analysis. In this review, we provide an historical chronicle of how R became what it is today, describing all its current features and capabilities. We also illustrate the major tools of R, such as the current R editors and integrated development environments (IDEs), the R Shiny web server, the R methods for machine learning, and its relationship with other programming languages. We also discuss the role of R in science in general as a driver for reproducibility. Overall, we hope to provide both a complete snapshot of R today and a practical compendium of the major features and applications of this programming language.",

    "abstract": "We study the feasibility of a Data Science assistant powered by a sequence-to-sequence transformer by training a new model JuPyT5 on all publicly available Jupyter Notebook GitHub repositories and developing a new metric: Data Science Problems (DSP). DSP is a collection of 1119 problems curated from 306 pedagogical notebooks with 92 dataset dependencies, natural language and Markdown problem descriptions, and assert-based unit tests. These notebooks were designed to test university students' mastery of various Python implementations of Math and Data Science, and we now leverage them to study the ability of JuPyT5 to understand and pass the tests. We analyze the content of DSP, validate its quality, and we find that given 100 sampling attempts JuPyT5 is able to solve 77.5\\% of the DSP problems. We further present various ablation and statistical analyses and compare DSP to other recent natural language to code benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Computer science as an academic discipline began in the 1960\u2019s. Emphasis was on programming languages, compilers, operating systems, and the mathematical theory that supported these areas. Courses in theoretical computer science covered finite automata, regular expressions, context-free languages, and computability. In the 1970\u2019s, the study of algorithms was added as an important component of theory. The emphasis was on making computers useful. Today, a fundamental change is taking place and the focus is more on applications. There are many reasons for this change. The merging of computing and communications has played an important role. The enhanced ability to observe, collect, and store data in the natural sciences, in commerce, and in other fields calls for a change in our understanding of data and how to handle it in the modern setting. The emergence of the web and social networks as central aspects of daily life presents both opportunities and challenges for theory.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, the explosion of genomic data collection and the cloud computing revolution have made computational and data science research accessible to anyone with a web browser and an internet connection. However, students at institutions with limited resources have received relatively little exposure to curricula or professional development opportunities that lead to careers in genomic data science. To broaden participation in genomics research, the scientific community needs to support these programs in local education and research at underserved institutions (UIs). These include community colleges, historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribal colleges and universities that support ethnically, racially, and socioeconomically underrepresented students in the United States. We have formed the Genomic Data Science Community Network to support students, faculty, and their networks to identify opportunities and broaden access to genomic data science. These opportunities include expanding access to infrastructure and data, providing UI faculty development opportunities, strengthening collaborations among faculty, recognizing UI teaching and research excellence, fostering student awareness, developing modular and open-source resources, expanding course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), building curriculum, supporting student professional development and research, and removing financial barriers through funding programs and collaborator support.",

    "title": "CRISP-DM Twenty Years Later: From Data Mining Processes to Data Science Trajectories",
    "abstract": "CRISP-DM(CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) has its origins in the second half of the nineties and is thus about two decades old. According to many surveys and user polls it is still the de facto standard for developing data mining and knowledge discovery projects. However, undoubtedly the field has moved on considerably in twenty years, with data science now the leading term being favoured over data mining. In this paper we investigate whether, and in what contexts, CRISP-DM is still fit for purpose for data science projects. We argue that if the project is goal-directed and process-driven the process model view still largely holds. On the other hand, when data science projects become more exploratory the paths that the project can take become more varied, and a more flexible model is called for. We suggest what the outlines of such a trajectory-based model might look like and how it can be used to categorise data science projects (goal-directed, exploratory or data management). We examine seven real-life exemplars where exploratory activities play an important role and compare them against 51 use cases extracted from the NIST Big Data Public Working Group. We anticipate this categorisation can help project planning in terms of time and cost characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Data science (DS) projects often follow a lifecycle that consists of laborious tasks for data scientists and domain experts (e.g., data exploration, model training, etc.). Only till recently, machine learning(ML) researchers have developed promising automation techniques to aid data workers in these tasks. This paper introduces AutoDS, an automated machine learning (AutoML) system that aims to leverage the latest ML automation techniques to support data science projects. Data workers only need to upload their dataset, then the system can automatically suggest ML configurations, preprocess data, select algorithm, and train the model. These suggestions are presented to the user via a web-based graphical user interface and a notebook-based programming user interface. Our goal is to offer a systematic investigation of user interaction and perceptions of using an AutoDS system in solving a data science task. We studied AutoDS with 30 professional data scientists, where one group used AutoDS, and the other did not, to complete a data science project. As expected, AutoDS improves productivity; Yet surprisingly, we find that the models produced by the AutoDS group have higher quality and less errors, but lower human confidence scores. We reflect on the findings by presenting design implications for incorporating automation techniques into human work in the data science lifecycle.",

    "abstract": "Increasingly larger number of software systems today are including data science components for descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. The collection of data science stages from acquisition, to cleaning/curation, to modeling, and so on are referred to as data science pipelines. To facilitate research and practice on data science pipelines, it is essential to understand their nature. What are the typical stages of a data science pipeline? How are they connected? Do the pipelines differ in the theoretical representations and that in the practice? Today we do not fully understand these architectural characteristics of data science pipelines. In this work, we present a three-pronged comprehensive study to answer this for the state-of-the-art, data science in-the-small, and data science in-the-large, Our study analyzes three datasets: a collection of 71 proposals for data science pipelines and related concepts in theory, a collection of over 105 implementations of curated data science pipelines from Kaggle competitions to understand data science in-the-small, and a collection of 21 mature data science projects from GitHub to understand data science in-the-large. Our study has led to three representations of data science pipelines that capture the essence of our subjects in theory, in-the-small, and in-the-large.",

    "title": "Spectral Methods for Data Science: A Statistical Perspective",
    "abstract": "Spectral methods have emerged as a simple yet surprisingly effective approach for extracting information from massive, noisy and incomplete data. In a nutshell, spectral methods refer to a collection of algorithms built upon the eigenvalues (resp. singular values) and eigenvectors (resp. singular vectors) of some properly designed matrices constructed from data. A diverse array of applications have been found in machine learning, data science, and signal processing. Due to their simplicity and effectiveness, spectral methods are not only used as a stand-alone estimator, but also frequently employed to initialize other more sophisticated algorithms to improve performance. \nWhile the studies of spectral methods can be traced back to classical matrix perturbation theory and methods of moments, the past decade has witnessed tremendous theoretical advances in demystifying their efficacy through the lens of statistical modeling, with the aid of non-asymptotic random matrix theory. This monograph aims to present a systematic, comprehensive, yet accessible introduction to spectral methods from a modern statistical perspective, highlighting their algorithmic implications in diverse large-scale applications. In particular, our exposition gravitates around several central questions that span various applications: how to characterize the sample efficiency of spectral methods in reaching a target level of statistical accuracy, and how to assess their stability in the face of random noise, missing data, and adversarial corruptions? In addition to conventional $\\ell_2$ perturbation analysis, we present a systematic $\\ell_{\\infty}$ and $\\ell_{2,\\infty}$ perturbation theory for eigenspace and singular subspaces, which has only recently become available owing to a powerful \"leave-one-out\" analysis framework.",

    "abstract": "By combining metal nodes with organic linkers we can potentially synthesize millions of possible metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs). The fact that we have so many materials opens many exciting avenues but also create new challenges. We simply have too many materials to be processed using conventional, brute force, methods. In this review, we show that having so many materials allows us to use big-data methods as a powerful technique to study these materials and to discover complex correlations. The first part of the review gives an introduction to the principles of big-data science. We show how to select appropriate training sets, survey approaches that are used to represent these materials in feature space, and review different learning architectures, as well as evaluation and interpretation strategies. In the second part, we review how the different approaches of machine learning have been applied to porous materials. In particular, we discuss applications in the field of gas storage and separation, the stability of these materials, their electronic properties, and their synthesis. Given the increasing interest of the scientific community in machine learning, we expect this list to rapidly expand in the coming years.",

    "abstract": ". The government and industry currently use information and communication technology a lot. The government and companies in Indonesia have regulations on procedures for managing information and communication system security. Information security is critical because there are many threats to information security. Information security in this era of information and communication technology (ICT) is fundamental. Information Exchange Environment (IEE) vulnerabilities have increased as threats become more widespread and complex. Information security has become a fundamental issue for businesses, organizations, and governments. In this paper, a review of the impact of information security on the government and companies is described in terms of threats and types of information security. Some security system methods are analyzed, including\u2014 application security, cloud security, cryptography, security infrastructure, incident response, and vulnerability management. The results of this review analysis, it is known that threats have several solutions, each depending on the type of threat for both the Government and the companies. Furthermore, information security is considered very important, especially for data stored in government and companies.",

    "abstract": "Today, the prominence of data science within organizations has given rise to teams of data science workers collaborating on extracting insights from data, as opposed to individual data scientists working alone. However, we still lack a deep understanding of how data science workers collaborate in practice. In this work, we conducted an online survey with 183 participants who work in various aspects of data science. We focused on their reported interactions with each other (e.g., managers with engineers) and with different tools (e.g., Jupyter Notebook). We found that data science teams are extremely collaborative and work with a variety of stakeholders and tools during the six common steps of a data science workflow (e.g., clean data and train model). We also found that the collaborative practices workers employ, such as documentation, vary according to the kinds of tools they use. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications for supporting data science team collaborations and future research directions.",

    "title": "Leveraging Data Science to Combat COVID-19: A Comprehensive Review",
    "abstract": "COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in March 2020. By mid-August 2020, more than 21 million people have tested positive worldwide. Infections have been growing rapidly and tremendous efforts are being made to fight the disease. In this paper, we attempt to systematise the various COVID-19 research activities leveraging data science, where we define data science broadly to encompass the various methods and tools\u2014including those from artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), statistics, modeling, simulation, and data visualization\u2014that can be used to store, process, and extract insights from data. In addition to reviewing the rapidly growing body of recent research, we survey public datasets and repositories that can be used for further work to track COVID-19 spread and mitigation strategies. As part of this, we present a bibliometric analysis of the papers produced in this short span of time. Finally, building on these insights, we highlight common challenges and pitfalls observed across the surveyed works. We also created a live resource repository at https://github.com/Data-Science-and-COVID-19/Leveraging-Data-Science-To-Combat-COVID-19-A-Comprehensive-Review that we intend to keep updated with the latest resources including new papers and datasets.",

    "abstract": "Many modern data science applications build on data lakes, schema-agnostic repositories of data files and data products that offer limited organization and management capabilities. There is a need to build data lake search capabilities into data science environments, so scientists and analysts can find tables, schemas, workflows, and datasets useful to their task at hand. We develop search and management solutions for the Jupyter Notebook data science platform, to enable scientists to augment training data, find potential features to extract, clean data, and find joinable or linkable tables. Our core methods also generalize to other settings where computational tasks involve execution of programs or scripts.",

    "abstract": "Stanford Medicine is building a new data platform for our academic research community to do better clinical data science. Hospitals have a large amount of patient data and researchers have demonstrated the ability to reuse that data and AI approaches to derive novel insights, support patient care, and improve care quality. However, the traditional data warehouse and Honest Broker approaches that are in current use, are not scalable. We are establishing a new secure Big Data platform that aims to reduce time to access and analyze data. In this platform, data is anonymized to preserve patient data privacy and made available preparatory to Institutional Review Board (IRB) submission. Furthermore, the data is standardized such that analysis done at Stanford can be replicated elsewhere using the same analytical code and clinical concepts. Finally, the analytics data warehouse integrates with a secure data science computational facility to support large scale data analytics. The ecosystem is designed to bring the modern data science community to highly sensitive clinical data in a secure and collaborative big data analytics environment with a goal to enable bigger, better and faster science.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a state-of-the-art investigation of advances in data science in emerging economic applications. The analysis was performed on novel data science methods in four individual classes of deep learning models, hybrid deep learning models, hybrid machine learning, and ensemble models. Application domains include a wide and diverse range of economics research from the stock market, marketing, and e-commerce to corporate banking and cryptocurrency. Prisma method, a systematic literature review methodology, was used to ensure the quality of the survey. The findings reveal that the trends follow the advancement of hybrid models, which, based on the accuracy metric, outperform other learning algorithms. It is further expected that the trends will converge toward the advancements of sophisticated hybrid deep learning models.",

    "abstract": "How are data science systems made to work? It may seem that whether a system works is a function of its technical design, but it is also accomplished through ongoing forms of discretionary work by many actors. Based on six months of ethnographic fieldwork with a corporate data science team, we describe how actors involved in a corporate project negotiated what work the system should do, how it should work, and how to assess whether it works. These negotiations laid the foundation for how, why, and to what extent the system ultimately worked. We describe three main findings. First, how already-existing technologies are essential reference points to determine how and whether systems work. Second, how the situated resolution of development challenges continually reshapes the understanding of how and whether systems work. Third, how business goals, and especially their negotiated balance with data science imperatives, affect a system\u2019s working. We conclude with takeaways for critical data studies, orienting researchers to focus on the organizational and cultural aspects of data science, the third-party platforms underlying data science systems, and ways to engage with practitioners\u2019 imagination of how systems can and should work.",

    "title": "Big Earth Data science: an information framework for a sustainable planet",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The digital transformation of our society coupled with the increasing exploitation of natural resources makes sustainability challenges more complex and dynamic than ever before. These changes will unlikely stop or even decelerate in the near future. There is an urgent need for a new scientific approach and an advanced form of evidence-based decision-making towards the benefit of society, the economy, and the environment. To understand the impacts and interrelationships between humans as a society and natural Earth system processes, we propose a new engineering discipline, Big Earth Data science. This science is called to provide the methodologies and tools to generate knowledge from diverse, numerous, and complex data sources necessary to ensure a sustainable human society essential for the preservation of planet Earth. Big Earth Data science aims at utilizing data from Earth observation and social sensing and develop theories for understanding the mechanisms of how such a social-physical system operates and evolves. The manuscript introduces the universe of discourse characterizing this new science, its foundational paradigms and methodologies, and a possible technological framework to be implemented by applying an ecosystem approach. CASEarth and GEOSS are presented as examples of international implementation attempts. Conclusions discuss important challenges and collaboration opportunities.",

    "title": "Fixed Point Strategies in Data Science",
    "abstract": "The goal of this article is to promote the use of fixed point strategies in data science by showing that they provide a simplifying and unifying framework to model, analyze, and solve a great variety of problems. They are seen to constitute a natural environment to explain the behavior of advanced convex optimization methods as well as of recent nonlinear methods in data science which are formulated in terms of paradigms that go beyond minimization concepts and involve constructs such as Nash equilibria or monotone inclusions. We review the pertinent tools of fixed point theory and describe the main state-of-the-art algorithms for provenly convergent fixed point construction. We also incorporate additional ingredients such as stochasticity, block-implementations, and non-Euclidean metrics, which provide further enhancements. Applications to signal and image processing, machine learning, statistics, neural networks, and inverse problems are discussed.",

    "title": "Process Mining for Python (PM4Py): Bridging the Gap Between Process- and Data Science",
    "abstract": "Process mining, i.e., a sub-field of data science focusing on the analysis of event data generated during the execution of (business) processes, has seen a tremendous change over the past two decades. Starting off in the early 2000's, with limited to no tool support, nowadays, several software tools, i.e., both open-source, e.g., ProM and Apromore, and commercial, e.g., Disco, Celonis, ProcessGold, etc., exist. The commercial process mining tools provide limited support for implementing custom algorithms. Moreover, both commercial and open-source process mining tools are often only accessible through a graphical user interface, which hampers their usage in large-scale experimental settings. Initiatives such as RapidProM provide process mining support in the scientific workflow-based data science suite RapidMiner. However, these offer limited to no support for algorithmic customization. In the light of the aforementioned, in this paper, we present a novel process mining library, i.e. Process Mining for Python (PM4Py) that aims to bridge this gap, providing integration with state-of-the-art data science libraries, e.g., pandas, numpy, scipy and scikit-learn. We provide a global overview of the architecture and functionality of PM4Py, accompanied by some representative examples of its usage.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is changing our lives in many ways. One application domain is data science. New techniques in automating the creation of AI, known as AutoAI or AutoML, aim to automate the work practices of data scientists. AutoAI systems are capable of autonomously ingesting and pre-processing data, engineering new features, and creating and scoring models based on a target objectives (e.g. accuracy or run-time efficiency). Though not yet widely adopted, we are interested in understanding how AutoAI will impact the practice of data science. We conducted interviews with 20 data scientists who work at a large, multinational technology company and practice data science in various business settings. Our goal is to understand their current work practices and how these practices might change with AutoAI. Reactions were mixed: while informants expressed concerns about the trend of automating their jobs, they also strongly felt it was inevitable. Despite these concerns, they remained optimistic about their future job security due to a view that the future of data science work will be a collaboration between humans and AI systems, in which both automation and human expertise are indispensable.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of big data, there has been an increasing need for practitioners in this space and an increasing opportunity for researchers to understand their workflows and design new tools to improve it. Data science is often described as data-driven, comprising unambiguous data and proceeding through regularized steps of analysis. However, this view focuses more on abstract processes, pipelines, and workflows, and less on how data science workers engage with the data. In this paper, we build on the work of other CSCW and HCI researchers in describing the ways that scientists, scholars, engineers, and others work with their data, through analyses of interviews with 21 data science professionals. We set five approaches to data along a dimension of interventions: Data as given; as captured; as curated; as designed; and as created. Data science workers develop an intuitive sense of their data and processes, and actively shape their data. We propose new ways to apply these interventions analytically, to make sense of the complex activities around data practices.",

    "title": "Vamsa: Automated Provenance Tracking in Data Science Scripts",
    "abstract": "There has recently been a lot of ongoing research in the areas of fairness, bias and explainability of machine learning (ML) models due to the self-evident or regulatory requirements of various ML applications. We make the following observation: All of these approaches require a robust understanding of the relationship between ML models and the data used to train them. In this work, we introduce the ML provenance tracking problem: the fundamental idea is to automatically track which columns in a dataset have been used to derive the features/labels of an ML model. We discuss the challenges in capturing such information in the context of Python, the most common language used by data scientists. We then present Vamsa, a modular system that extracts provenance from Python scripts without requiring any changes to the users' code. Using 26K real data science scripts, we verify the effectiveness of Vamsa in terms of coverage, and performance. We also evaluate Vamsa's accuracy on a smaller subset of manually labeled data. Our analysis shows that Vamsa's precision and recall range from 90.4% to 99.1% and its latency is in the order of milliseconds for average size scripts. Drawing from our experience in deploying ML models in production, we also present an example in which Vamsa helps automatically identify models that are affected by data corruption issues.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\u2013Nolan and Temple Lang\u2019s Computing in the Statistics Curricula (2010) advocated for a shift in statistical education to broadly include computing. In the time since, individuals with training in both computing and statistics have become increasingly employable in the burgeoning data science field. In response, universities have developed new courses and programs to meet the growing demand for data science education. To address this demand, we created Data Science in Practice, a large-enrollment undergraduate course. Here, we present our goals for teaching this course, including: (1) conceptualizing data science as creative problem solving, with a focus on project-based learning, (2) prioritizing practical application, teaching and using standardized tools and best practices, and (3) scaling education through coursework that enables hands-on and classroom learning in a large-enrollment course. Throughout this course we also emphasize social context and data ethics to best prepare students for the interdisciplinary and impactful nature of their work. We highlight creative problem solving and strategies for teaching automation-resilient skills, while providing students the opportunity to create a unique data science project that demonstrates their technical and creative capacities.",

However, there does not appear to be a consensus on the fundamental principles, expertise, skills, or knowledge-base needed to define an academic discipline. We argue that data science is not a discipline but rather an umbrella term used to describe a complex process involving not one data scientist possessing all the necessary expertise, but a team of data scientists with nonoverlapping complementary skills. We provide some recommendations for how to take this into account when designing data science academic programs.Keywords: applied statistics, data science, data science curriculum, data wrangling, machine learning, software engineering",

    "abstract": "Data are invaluable. How can we assess the value of data objectively, systematically and quantitatively? Pricing data, or information goods in general, has been studied and practiced in dispersed areas and principles, such as economics, marketing, electronic commerce, data management, data mining and machine learning. In this article, we present a unified, interdisciplinary and comprehensive overview of this important direction. We examine various motivations behind data pricing, understand the economics of data pricing and review the development and evolution of pricing models according to a series of fundamental principles. We discuss both digital products and data products. We also consider a series of challenges and directions for future work.",

    "abstract": "Significance Predictability, computability, and stability (PCS) are three core principles of data science. They embed the scientific principles of prediction and replication in data-driven decision making while recognizing the central role of computation. Based on these principles, we propose the PCS framework, including workflow and documentation (in R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook). The PCS framework aims at responsible, reliable, reproducible, and transparent analysis across fields of science, social science, engineering, business, and government. It can be used as a recommendation system for scientific hypothesis generation and experimental design. In particular, we propose (basic) PCS inference for reliability measures on data results, extending statistical inference to a much broader scope as current data science practice entails. Building and expanding on principles of statistics, machine learning, and scientific inquiry, we propose the predictability, computability, and stability (PCS) framework for veridical data science. Our framework, composed of both a workflow and documentation, aims to provide responsible, reliable, reproducible, and transparent results across the data science life cycle. The PCS workflow uses predictability as a reality check and considers the importance of computation in data collection/storage and algorithm design. It augments predictability and computability with an overarching stability principle. Stability expands on statistical uncertainty considerations to assess how human judgment calls impact data results through data and model/algorithm perturbations. As part of the PCS workflow, we develop PCS inference procedures, namely PCS perturbation intervals and PCS hypothesis testing, to investigate the stability of data results relative to problem formulation, data cleaning, modeling decisions, and interpretations. We illustrate PCS inference through neuroscience and genomics projects of our own and others. Moreover, we demonstrate its favorable performance over existing methods in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in high-dimensional, sparse linear model simulations, including a wide range of misspecified models. Finally, we propose PCS documentation based on R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook, with publicly available, reproducible codes and narratives to back up human choices made throughout an analysis. The PCS workflow and documentation are demonstrated in a genomics case study available on Zenodo.",

    "title": "Algorithmic Government: Automating Public Services and Supporting Civil Servants in using Data Science Technologies",
    "abstract": "The data science technologies of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), big data and behavioral/predictive analytics, and blockchain are poised to revolutionize government and create a new generation of GovTech start-ups. The impact from the \u2018smartification\u2019 of public services and the national infrastructure will be much more significant in comparison to any other sector given government's function and importance to every institution and individual. Potential GovTech systems include Chatbots and intelligent assistants for public engagement, Robo-advisors to support civil servants, real-time management of the national infrastructure using IoT and blockchain, automated compliance/regulation, public records securely stored in blockchain distributed ledgers, online judicial and dispute resolution systems, and laws/statutes encoded as blockchain smart contracts. Government is potentially the major \u2018client\u2019 and also \u2018public champion\u2019 for these new data technologies. This review paper uses our simple taxonomy of government services to provide an overview of data science automation being deployed by governments world-wide. The goal of this review paper is to encourage the Computer Science community to engage with government to develop these new systems to transform public services and support the work of civil servants.",

    "abstract": "Public health surveillance is the ongoing systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of data, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of the resulting information to those responsible for preventing and controlling disease and injury. With the rapid development of data science, encompassing big data and artificial intelligence, and with the exponential growth of accessible and highly heterogeneous health-related data, from healthcare providers to user-generated online content, the field of surveillance and health monitoring is changing rapidly. It is, therefore, the right time for a short glossary of key terms in public health surveillance, with an emphasis on new data-science developments in the field.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The proliferation of vast quantities of available datasets that are large and complex in nature has challenged universities to keep up with the demand for graduates trained in both the statistical and the computational set of skills required to effectively plan, acquire, manage, analyze, and communicate the findings of such data. To keep up with this demand, attracting students early on to data science as well as providing them a solid foray into the field becomes increasingly important. We present a case study of an introductory undergraduate course in data science that is designed to address these needs. Offered at Duke University, this course has no prerequisites and serves a wide audience of aspiring statistics and data science majors as well as humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences students. We discuss the unique set of challenges posed by offering such a course, and in light of these challenges, we present a detailed discussion into the pedagogical design elements, content, structure, computational infrastructure, and the assessment methodology of the course. We also offer a repository containing all teaching materials that are open-source, along with supplementary materials and the R code for reproducing the figures found in the article.",

    "abstract": "textabstractThe rise of Data Science has caused an influx of new usersin need of data management solutions. However, insteadof utilizing existing RDBMS solutions they are opting touse a stack of independent solutions for data storage andprocessing glued together by scripting languages. This is notbecause they do not need the functionality that an integratedRDBMS provides, but rather because existing RDBMS im-plementations do not cater to their use case. To solve theseissues, we propose a new class of data management systems:embedded analytical systems. These systems are tightlyintegrated with analytical tools, and provide fast and effi-cient access to the data stored within them. In this work,we describe the unique challenges and opportunities w.r.tworkloads, resilience and cooperation that are faced by thisnew class of systems and the steps we have taken towardsaddressing them in the DuckDB system.",

    "abstract": "Data science is a rapidly growing discipline and organizations increasingly depend on data science work. Yet the ambiguity around data science, what it is, and who data scientists are can make it difficult for visualization researchers to identify impactful research trajectories. We have conducted a retrospective analysis of data science work and workers as described within the data visualization, human computer interaction, and data science literature. From this analysis we synthesis a comprehensive model that describes data science work and breakdown to data scientists into nine distinct roles. We summarise and reflect on the role that visualization has throughout data science work and the varied needs of data scientists themselves for tooling support. Our findings are intended to arm visualization researchers with a more concrete framing of data science with the hope that it will help them surface innovative opportunities for impacting data science work.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the past 10 years, new data science courses and programs have proliferated at the collegiate level. As faculty and administrators enter the race to provide data science training and attract new students, the road map for teaching data science remains elusive. In 2019, 69 college and university faculty teaching data science courses and developing data science curricula were surveyed to learn about their curricula, computing tools, and challenges they face in their classrooms. Faculty reported teaching a variety of computing skills in introductory data science (albeit fewer computing topics than statistics topics), and that one of the biggest challenges they face is teaching computing to a diverse audience with varying preparation. The ever-evolving nature of data science is a major hurdle for faculty teaching data science courses, and a call for more data science teaching resources was echoed in many responses.",

    "title": "50 Years of Data Science",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In \u201cThe Future of Data Analysis,\u201d he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or \u201cdata analysis.\u201d Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name \u201cdata science\u201d for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of \u201cdata science\u201d programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a $100M \u201cData Science Initiative\u201d that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d This article reviews some ingredients of the current \u201cdata science moment,\u201d including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for \u201cscaling up\u201d to \u201cbig data.\u201d This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere \u201cscaling up,\u201d but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are \u201clearning from data,\u201d and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today\u2019s data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals. Based on a presentation at the Tukey Centennial Workshop, Princeton, NJ, September 18, 2015.",

    "title": "Outbreak analytics: a developing data science for informing the response to emerging pathogens",
    "abstract": "Despite continued efforts to improve health systems worldwide, emerging pathogen epidemics remain a major public health concern. Effective response to such outbreaks relies on timely intervention, ideally informed by all available sources of data. The collection, visualization and analysis of outbreak data are becoming increasingly complex, owing to the diversity in types of data, questions and available methods to address them. Recent advances have led to the rise of outbreak analytics, an emerging data science focused on the technological and methodological aspects of the outbreak data pipeline, from collection to analysis, modelling and reporting to inform outbreak response. In this article, we assess the current state of the field. After laying out the context of outbreak response, we critically review the most common analytics components, their inter-dependencies, data requirements and the type of information they can provide to inform operations in real time. We discuss some challenges and opportunities and conclude on the potential role of outbreak analytics for improving our understanding of, and response to outbreaks of emerging pathogens. This article is part of the theme issue \u2018Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting and control\u2018. This theme issue is linked with the earlier issue \u2018Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: approaches and important themes\u2019.",

    "title": "Practitioners Teaching Data Science in Industry and Academia: Expectations, Workflows, and Challenges",
    "abstract": "Data science has been growing in prominence across both academia and industry, but there is still little formal consensus about how to teach it. Many people who currently teach data science are practitioners such as computational researchers in academia or data scientists in industry. To understand how these practitioner-instructors pass their knowledge onto novices and how that contrasts with teaching more traditional forms of programming, we interviewed 20 data scientists who teach in settings ranging from small-group workshops to large online courses. We found that: 1) they must empathize with a diverse array of student backgrounds and expectations, 2) they teach technical workflows that integrate authentic practices surrounding code, data, and communication, 3) they face challenges involving authenticity versus abstraction in software setup, finding and curating pedagogically-relevant datasets, and acclimating students to live with uncertainty in data analysis. These findings can point the way toward better tools for data science education and help bring data literacy to more people around the world.",

    "title": "SystemDS: A Declarative Machine Learning System for the End-to-End Data Science Lifecycle",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) applications become increasingly common in many domains. ML systems to execute these workloads include numerical computing frameworks and libraries, ML algorithm libraries, and specialized systems for deep neural networks and distributed ML. These systems focus primarily on efficient model training and scoring. However, the data science process is exploratory, and deals with underspecified objectives and a wide variety of heterogeneous data sources. Therefore, additional tools are employed for data engineering and debugging, which requires boundary crossing, unnecessary manual effort, and lacks optimization across the lifecycle. In this paper, we introduce SystemDS, an open source ML system for the end-to-end data science lifecycle from data integration, cleaning, and preparation, over local, distributed, and federated ML model training, to debugging and serving. To this end, we aim to provide a stack of declarative languages with R-like syntax for the different lifecycle tasks, and users with different expertise. We describe the overall system architecture, explain major design decisions (motivated by lessons learned from Apache SystemML), and discuss key features and research directions. Finally, we provide preliminary results that show the potential of end-to-end lifecycle optimization.",

    "abstract": "Data science is the science of extracting meaning from potentially complex data. This is a fast moving field, drawing principles and techniques from a number of different disciplinary areas including computer science, statistics and complexity science. Data science is having a profound impact on a number of areas including commerce, health and smart cities. This paper argues that data science can have an equal if not greater impact in the area of earth and environmental sciences, offering a rich tapestry of new techniques to support both a deeper understanding of the natural environment in all its complexities, as well as the development of well-founded mitigation and adaptation strategies in the face of climate change. The paper argues that data science for the natural environment brings about new challenges for data science, particularly around complexity, spatial and temporal reasoning, and managing uncertainty. The paper also describes a case study in environmental data science which offers up insights into the promise of the area. The paper concludes with a research roadmap highlighting ten top challenges of environmental data science and also an invitation to become part of an international community working collaboratively on these problems.",

    "abstract": "Background Health care data are increasing in volume and complexity. Storing and analyzing these data to implement precision medicine initiatives and data-driven research has exceeded the capabilities of traditional computer systems. Modern big data platforms must be adapted to the specific demands of health care and designed for scalability and growth. Objective The objectives of our study were to (1) demonstrate the implementation of a data science platform built on open source technology within a large, academic health care system and (2) describe 2 computational health care applications built on such a platform. Methods We deployed a data science platform based on several open source technologies to support real-time, big data workloads. We developed data-acquisition workflows for Apache Storm and NiFi in Java and Python to capture patient monitoring and laboratory data for downstream analytics. Results Emerging data management approaches, along with open source technologies such as Hadoop, can be used to create integrated data lakes to store large, real-time datasets. This infrastructure also provides a robust analytics platform where health care and biomedical research data can be analyzed in near real time for precision medicine and computational health care use cases. Conclusions The implementation and use of integrated data science platforms offer organizations the opportunity to combine traditional datasets, including data from the electronic health record, with emerging big data sources, such as continuous patient monitoring and real-time laboratory results. These platforms can enable cost-effective and scalable analytics for the information that will be key to the delivery of precision medicine initiatives. Organizations that can take advantage of the technical advances found in data science platforms will have the opportunity to provide comprehensive access to health care data for computational health care and precision medicine research.",

    "abstract": "The emerging field of Data Science has had a large impact on science and society. This has led to over a decade of calls to establish a corresponding field of Data Science Education. There is still a need, however, to more deeply conceptualize what a field of Data Science Education might entail in terms of scope, responsibility, and execution. This special issue explores how one distinguishing feature of Data Science\u2014its focus on data collected from social and environmental contexts within which learners often find themselves deeply embedded\u2014suggests serious implications for learning and education. The learning sciences is uniquely positioned to investigate how such contextual embeddings impact learners\u2019 engagement with data including conceptual, experiential, communal, racialized, spatial, and political dimensions. This special issue demonstrates the richly layered relationships learners build with data and reveals them to be not merely utilitarian mechanisms for learning about data, but a critical part of navigating data as social text and understanding Data Science as a discipline. Together, the contributions offer a vision of how the learning sciences can contribute to a more expansive, agentive and socially aware Data Science Education.",

    "abstract": "Big data and data science are transforming the world in ways that spawn new concerns for social scientists, such as the impacts of the internet on citizens and the media, the repercussions of smart cities, the possibilities of cyber-warfare and cyber-terrorism, the implications of precision medicine, and the consequences of artificial intelligence and automation. Along with these changes in society, powerful new data science methods support research using administrative, internet, textual, and sensor-audio-video data. Burgeoning data and innovative methods facilitate answering previously hard-to-tackle questions about society by offering new ways to form concepts from data, to do descriptive inference, to make causal inferences, and to generate predictions. They also pose challenges as social scientists must grasp the meaning of concepts and predictions generated by convoluted algorithms, weigh the relative value of prediction versus causal inference, and cope with ethical challenges as their methods, such as algorithms for mobilizing voters or determining bail, are adopted by policy makers.",

    "title": "Data science in data librarianship: Core competencies of a data librarian",
    "abstract": "Currently, data are stored in an always-on condition, and can be globally accessed at any point, by any user. Data librarianship has its origins in the social sciences. In particular, the creation of data services and data archives, in the United Kingdom (Data Archives Services) and in the United States and Canada (Data Library Services), is a key factor for the emergence of data librarianship. The focus of data librarianship nowadays is on the creation of new library services. Data librarians are concerned with the proposition of services for data management and curation in academic libraries and other research organizations. The purpose of this paper is to understand how the complexity of the data can serve as the basis for identifying the technical skills required by data librarians. This essay is systematically divided, first introducing the concepts of data and research data in data librarianship, followed by an overview of data science as a theory, method, and technology to assess data. Next, the identification of the competencies and skills required by data scientists and data librarians are discussed. Our final remarks highlight that data librarians should understand that the complexity and novelty associated with data science praxis. Data science provides new methods and practices for data librarianship. A data librarian need not become a programmer, statistician, or database manager, but should be interested in learning about the languages and programming logic of computers, databases, and information retrieval tools. We believe that numerous kinds of scientific data research provide opportunities for a data librarian to engage with data science.",

    "title": "Big Data and data science: A critical review of issues for educational research",
    "abstract": "Big Data refers to large and disparate volumes of data generated by people, applications and machines. It is gaining increasing attention from a variety of domains, including education. What are the challenges of engaging with Big Data research in education? This paper identifies a wide range of critical issues that researchers need to consider when working with Big Data in education. The issues identified include diversity in the conception and meaning of Big Data in education, ontological, epistemological disparity, technical challenges, ethics and privacy, digital divide and digital dividend, lack of expertise and academic development opportunities to prepare educational researchers to leverage opportunities afforded by Big Data. The goal of this paper is to raise awareness on these issues and initiate a dialogue. The paper was inspired partly by insights drawn from the literature but mostly informed by experience researching into Big Data in education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

    "abstract": "Non-technical summary Manhattan, Berlin and New Delhi all need to take action to adapt to climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While case studies on these cities provide valuable insights, comparability and scalability remain sidelined. It is therefore timely to review the state-of-the-art in data infrastructures, including earth observations, social media data, and how they could be better integrated to advance climate change science in cities and urban areas. We present three routes for expanding knowledge on global urban areas: mainstreaming data collections, amplifying the use of big data and taking further advantage of computational methods to analyse qualitative data to gain new insights. These data-based approaches have the potential to upscale urban climate solutions and effect change at the global scale. Technical summary Cities have an increasingly integral role in addressing climate change. To gain a common understanding of solutions, we require adequate and representative data of urban areas, including data on related greenhouse gas emissions, climate threats and of socio-economic contexts. Here, we review the current state of urban data science in the context of climate change, investigating the contribution of urban metabolism studies, remote sensing, big data approaches, urban economics, urban climate and weather studies. We outline three routes for upscaling urban data science for global climate solutions: 1) Mainstreaming and harmonizing data collection in cities worldwide; 2) Exploiting big data and machine learning to scale solutions while maintaining privacy; 3) Applying computational techniques and data science methods to analyse published qualitative information for the systematization and understanding of first-order climate effects and solutions. Collaborative efforts towards a joint data platform and integrated urban services would provide the quantitative foundations of the emerging global urban sustainability science.",

    "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that the emergence of \u201cBig Data\u201d is having a profound and often controversial impact on the production of knowledge. In this context, Data Science has developed as an interdisciplinary approach that turns such \u201cBig Data\u201d into information. This article argues for the positive role that Geography can have on Data Science when being applied to spatially explicit problems; and inversely, makes the case that there is much that Geography and Geographical Analysis could learn from Data Science. We propose a deeper integration through an ambitious research agenda, including systems engineering, new methodological development, and work toward addressing some acute challenges around epistemology. We argue that such issues must be resolved in order to realize a Geographic Data Science, and that such goal would be a desirable one.",

    "abstract": "Causal inference from observational data is the goal of many data analyses in the health and social sciences. However, academic statistics has often frowned upon data analyses with a causal objective. The introduction of the term \"data science\" provides a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in such a way that it naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we organize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks: Description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science. Specifically, causal analyses typically require not only good data and algorithms, but also domain expert knowledge. We discuss the implications for the use of data science to guide decision-making in the real world and to train data scientists.",

    "title": "A Data Science Framework for Movement",
    "abstract": "Author(s): Dodge, S | Abstract: \u00a9 2019 The Ohio State University Movement is the driving force behind the form and function of many ecological and human systems. Identification and analysis of movement patterns that may relate to the behavior of individuals and their interactions is a fundamental first step in understanding these systems. With advances in IoT and the ubiquity of smart connected sensors to collect movement and contextual data, we now have access to a wealth of geo-enriched high-resolution tracking data. These data promise new forms of knowledge and insight into movement of humans, animals, and goods, and hence can increase our understanding of complex spatiotemporal processes such as disease outbreak, urban mobility, migration, and human-species interaction. To take advantage of the evolution in our data, we need a revolution in how we visualize, model, and analyze movement as a multidimensional process that involves space, time, and context. This paper introduces a data science paradigm with the aim of advancing research on movement.",

    "title": "The Democratization of Data Science Education",
    "abstract": "Abstract Over the last three decades, data have become ubiquitous and cheap. This transition has accelerated over the last five years and training in statistics, machine learning, and data analysis has struggled to keep up. In April 2014, we launched a program of nine courses, the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization, which has now had more than 4 million enrollments over the past five years. Here, the program is described and compared to standard data science curricula as they were organized in 2014 and 2015. We show that novel pedagogical and administrative decisions introduced in our program are now standard in online data science programs. The impact of the Data Science Specialization on data science education in the U.S. is also discussed. Finally, we conclude with some thoughts about the future of data science education in a data democratized world.",

    "abstract": "In the expansion of health ecosystems, issues of responsibility and sustainability of the data science involved are central. The idea that these values should be central to the practice of data science is increasingly gaining traction, yet there is no agreement on what exactly makes data science responsible or sustainable because these concepts prove slippery when applied to a global field involving commercial, academic and governmental actors. This lack of clarity is causing problems in setting goals and boundaries for data scientific practice, and risks fundamental disagreement on governance principles for this emerging field. We will argue in this commentary for a commons analytical framework as one approach to this problem, since it offers useful signposts for how to establish governance principles for shared resources.",

    "title": "Data science from a library and information science perspective",
    "abstract": "\nPurpose\nData science is a relatively new field which has gained considerable attention in recent years. This new field requires a wide range of knowledge and skills from different disciplines including mathematics and statistics, computer science and information science. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the study that explored the field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nAnalysis of research publications on data science was made on the basis of papers published in the Web of Science database. The following research questions were proposed: What are the main tendencies in publication years, document types, countries of origin, source titles, authors of publications, affiliations of the article authors and the most cited articles related to data science in the field of LIS? What are the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective?\n\n\nFindings\nThe highest contribution to data science comes from the computer science research community. The contribution of information science and library science community is quite small. However, there has been continuous increase in articles from the year 2015. The main document types are journal articles, followed by conference proceedings and editorial material. The top three journals that publish data science papers from the LIS perspective are the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the International Journal of Information Management and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. The top five countries publishing are USA, China, England, Australia and India. The most cited article has got 112 citations. The analysis revealed that the data science field is quite interdisciplinary by nature. In addition to the field of LIS the papers belonged to several other research areas. The reviewed articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe limitations of this research are that this study only analyzed research papers in the Web of Science database and therefore only covers a certain amount of scientific papers published in the field of LIS. In addition, only publications with the term \u201cdata science\u201d in the topic area of the Web of Science database were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that are not reflected in the Web of Science database or were related to other keywords such as \u201ce-science,\u201d \u201ce-research,\u201d \u201cdata service,\u201d \u201cdata curation\u201d or \u201cresearch data management.\u201d\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe field of data science has not been explored using bibliographic analysis of publications from the perspective of the LIS. This paper helps to better understand the field of data science and the perspectives for information professionals.\n",

    "abstract": "Abstract Data science is a rapidly growing field with applications across all scientific domains. The demand for support in data science literacy is outpacing available resources at college campuses. The academic library is uniquely positioned to provide training and guidance in a number of areas relevant to data science. The University of Arizona Libraries has built a successful data science support program, focusing on computational literacy, geographic information systems, and reproducible science. Success of the program has largely been due to the strength of library personnel and strategic partnerships with units outside of the library. Academic libraries can support campus data science needs through professional development of current staff and recruitment of new personnel with expertise in data-intensive domains.",

    "abstract": "The Data Science for Local Government project was about understanding how the growth of \u2018data science\u2019 is changing the way that local government works in the UK. We define data science as a dual shift which involves both bringing in new decision making and analytical techniques to local government work (e.g. machine learning and predictive analytics, artificial intelligence and A/B testing) and also expanding the types of data local government makes use of (for example, by repurposing administrative data, harvesting social media data, or working with mobile phone companies). The emergence of data science is facilitated by the growing availability of free, open-source tools for both collecting data and performing analysis. Based on extensive documentary review, a nationwide survey of local authorities, and in-depth interviews with over 30 practitioners, we have sought to produce a comprehensive guide to the different types of data science being undertaken in the UK, the types of opportunities and benefits created, and also some of the challenges and difficulties being encountered. Our aim was to provide a basis for people working in local government to start on their own data science projects, both by providing a library of dozens of ideas which have been tried elsewhere and also by providing hints and tips for overcoming key problems and challenges.",

    "title": "Theory-Guided Data Science: A New Paradigm for Scientific Discovery from Data",
    "abstract": "Data science models, although successful in a number of commercial domains, have had limited applicability in scientific problems involving complex physical phenomena. Theory-guided data science (TGDS) is an emerging paradigm that aims to leverage the wealth of scientific knowledge for improving the effectiveness of data science models in enabling scientific discovery. The overarching vision of TGDS is to introduce scientific consistency as an essential component for learning generalizable models. Further, by producing scientifically interpretable models, TGDS aims to advance our scientific understanding by discovering novel domain insights. Indeed, the paradigm of TGDS has started to gain prominence in a number of scientific disciplines such as turbulence modeling, material discovery, quantum chemistry, bio-medical science, bio-marker discovery, climate science, and hydrology. In this paper, we formally conceptualize the paradigm of TGDS and present a taxonomy of research themes in TGDS. We describe several approaches for integrating domain knowledge in different research themes using illustrative examples from different disciplines. We also highlight some of the promising avenues of novel research for realizing the full potential of theory-guided data science.",

    "title": "Data Science as Political Action: Grounding Data Science in a Politics of Justice",
    "abstract": "In response to recent controversies, the field of data science has rushed to adopt codes of ethics. Such professional codes, however, are ill-equipped to address broad matters of social justice. Instead of ethics codes, I argue, the field must embrace politics. Data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors engaged in normative constructions of society and, as befits political work, evaluate their work according to its downstream material impacts on people's lives. I justify this notion in two parts: first, by articulating why data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors, and second, by describing how the field can evolve toward a deliberative and rigorous grounding in a politics of social justice. Part 1 responds to three arguments that are commonly invoked by data scientists when they are challenged to take political positions regarding their work. In confronting these arguments, I will demonstrate why attempting to remain apolitical is itself a political stance--a fundamentally conservative one--and why the field's current attempts to promote \"social good\" dangerously rely on vague and unarticulated political assumptions. Part 2 proposes a framework for what a politically-engaged data science could look like and how to achieve it, recognizing the challenge of reforming the field in this manner. I conceptualize the process of incorporating politics into data science in four stages: becoming interested in directly addressing social issues, recognizing the politics underlying these issues, redirecting existing methods toward new applications, and, finally, developing new practices and methods that orient data science around a mission of social justice. The path ahead does not require data scientists to abandon their technical expertise, but it does entail expanding their notions of what problems to work on and how to engage with society.",

Paradigms and tools from data science and machine learning can provide scalable approaches to identify and extract trends and patterns within voluminous data sets, perform guided traversals of high-dimensional phase spaces, and furnish data-driven strategies for inverse materials design. This topical review provides an accessible introduction to machine learning tools in the context of soft and biological materials by \u2018de-jargonizing\u2019 data science terminology, presenting a taxonomy of machine learning techniques, and surveying the mathematical underpinnings and software implementations of popular tools, including principal component analysis, independent component analysis, diffusion maps, support vector machines, and relative entropy. We present illustrative examples of machine learning applications in soft matter, including inverse design of self-assembling materials, nonlinear learning of protein folding landscapes, high-throughput antimicrobial peptide design, and data-driven materials design engines. We close with an outlook on the challenges and opportunities for the field.",
