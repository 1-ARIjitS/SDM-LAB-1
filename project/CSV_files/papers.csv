c082ccfcfe1afc696e371374146ba9380b84061e,The Role of ChatGPT in Data Science: How AI-Assisted Conversational Interfaces Are Revolutionizing the Field,"ChatGPT, a conversational AI interface that utilizes natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, is taking the world by storm and is the buzzword across many sectors today. Given the likely impact of this model on data science, through this perspective article, we seek to provide an overview of the potential opportunities and challenges associated with using ChatGPT in data science, provide readers with a snapshot of its advantages, and stimulate interest in its use for data science projects. The paper discusses how ChatGPT can assist data scientists in automating various aspects of their workflow, including data cleaning and preprocessing, model training, and result interpretation. It also highlights how ChatGPT has the potential to provide new insights and improve decision-making processes by analyzing unstructured data. We then examine the advantages of ChatGPT’s architecture, including its ability to be fine-tuned for a wide range of language-related tasks and generate synthetic data. Limitations and issues are also addressed, particularly around concerns about bias and plagiarism when using ChatGPT. Overall, the paper concludes that the benefits outweigh the costs and ChatGPT has the potential to greatly enhance the productivity and accuracy of data science workflows and is likely to become an increasingly important tool for intelligence augmentation in the field of data science. ChatGPT can assist with a wide range of natural language processing tasks in data science, including language translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification. However, while ChatGPT can save time and resources compared to training a model from scratch, and can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, it may not perform well on certain tasks if it has not been specifically trained for them. Additionally, the output of ChatGPT may be difficult to interpret, which could pose challenges for decision-making in data science applications.",62,10.3390/bdcc7020062,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c082ccfcfe1afc696e371374146ba9380b84061e,102,2023-03-27

88ca84ce36ddc1bf7b6593b7f73fe2663e2365ad,Foundations of Data Science,"Computer science as an academic discipline began in the 1960’s. Emphasis was on programming languages, compilers, operating systems, and the mathematical theory that supported these areas. Courses in theoretical computer science covered finite automata, regular expressions, context-free languages, and computability. In the 1970’s, the study of algorithms was added as an important component of theory. The emphasis was on making computers useful. Today, a fundamental change is taking place and the focus is more on applications. There are many reasons for this change. The merging of computing and communications has played an important role. The enhanced ability to observe, collect, and store data in the natural sciences, in commerce, and in other fields calls for a change in our understanding of data and how to handle it in the modern setting. The emergence of the web and social networks as central aspects of daily life presents both opportunities and challenges for theory.",76-198,10.1017/9781108755528,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/88ca84ce36ddc1bf7b6593b7f73fe2663e2365ad,291,2020-01-17
108acf9a358512a40191d857e2456aeaaac3303b,Diversifying the genomic data science research community,"Over the past 20 years, the explosion of genomic data collection and the cloud computing revolution have made computational and data science research accessible to anyone with a web browser and an internet connection. However, students at institutions with limited resources have received relatively little exposure to curricula or professional development opportunities that lead to careers in genomic data science. To broaden participation in genomics research, the scientific community needs to support these programs in local education and research at underserved institutions (UIs). These include community colleges, historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribal colleges and universities that support ethnically, racially, and socioeconomically underrepresented students in the United States. We have formed the Genomic Data Science Community Network to support students, faculty, and their networks to identify opportunities and broaden access to genomic data science. These opportunities include expanding access to infrastructure and data, providing UI faculty development opportunities, strengthening collaborations among faculty, recognizing UI teaching and research excellence, fostering student awareness, developing modular and open-source resources, expanding course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), building curriculum, supporting student professional development and research, and removing financial barriers through funding programs and collaborator support.",1231 - 1241,10.1101/gr.276496.121,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/108acf9a358512a40191d857e2456aeaaac3303b,5,2022-07-01
4c6e31458b0b44c1e8bd6e58f7d7e0767f7fde44,CRISP-DM Twenty Years Later: From Data Mining Processes to Data Science Trajectories,"CRISP-DM(CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) has its origins in the second half of the nineties and is thus about two decades old. According to many surveys and user polls it is still the de facto standard for developing data mining and knowledge discovery projects. However, undoubtedly the field has moved on considerably in twenty years, with data science now the leading term being favoured over data mining. In this paper we investigate whether, and in what contexts, CRISP-DM is still fit for purpose for data science projects. We argue that if the project is goal-directed and process-driven the process model view still largely holds. On the other hand, when data science projects become more exploratory the paths that the project can take become more varied, and a more flexible model is called for. We suggest what the outlines of such a trajectory-based model might look like and how it can be used to categorise data science projects (goal-directed, exploratory or data management). We examine seven real-life exemplars where exploratory activities play an important role and compare them against 51 use cases extracted from the NIST Big Data Public Working Group. We anticipate this categorisation can help project planning in terms of time and cost characteristics.",3048-3061,10.1109/tkde.2019.2962680,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4c6e31458b0b44c1e8bd6e58f7d7e0767f7fde44,148,2021-08-01

Only till recently, machine learning(ML) researchers have developed promising automation techniques to aid data workers in these tasks. This paper introduces AutoDS, an automated machine learning (AutoML) system that aims to leverage the latest ML automation techniques to support data science projects. Data workers only need to upload their dataset, then the system can automatically suggest ML configurations, preprocess data, select algorithm, and train the model. These suggestions are presented to the user via a web-based graphical user interface and a notebook-based programming user interface. Our goal is to offer a systematic investigation of user interaction and perceptions of using an AutoDS system in solving a data science task. We studied AutoDS with 30 professional data scientists, where one group used AutoDS, and the other did not, to complete a data science project. As expected, AutoDS improves productivity; Yet surprisingly, we find that the models produced by the AutoDS group have higher quality and less errors, but lower human confidence scores.

The collection of data science stages from acquisition, to cleaning/curation, to modeling, and so on are referred to as data science pipelines. To facilitate research and practice on data science pipelines, it is essential to understand their nature. What are the typical stages of a data science pipeline? How are they connected? Do the pipelines differ in the theoretical representations and that in the practice? Today we do not fully understand these architectural characteristics of data science pipelines. In this work, we present a three-pronged comprehensive study to answer this for the state-of-the-art, data science in-the-small, and data science in-the-large, Our study analyzes three datasets: a collection of 71 proposals for data science pipelines and related concepts in theory, a collection of over 105 implementations of curated data science pipelines from Kaggle competitions to understand data science in-the-small, and a collection of 21 mature data science projects from GitHub to understand data science in-the-large.

The fact that we have so many materials opens many exciting avenues but also create new challenges. We simply have too many materials to be processed using conventional, brute force, methods. In this review, we show that having so many materials allows us to use big-data methods as a powerful technique to study these materials and to discover complex correlations. The first part of the review gives an introduction to the principles of big-data science. We show how to select appropriate training sets, survey approaches that are used to represent these materials in feature space, and review different learning architectures, as well as evaluation and interpretation strategies. In the second part, we review how the different approaches of machine learning have been applied to porous materials.

2d6adb9636df5a8a5dbcbfaecd0c4d34d7c85034,Spectral Methods for Data Science: A Statistical Perspective,"Spectral methods have emerged as a simple yet surprisingly effective approach for extracting information from massive, noisy and incomplete data. In a nutshell, spectral methods refer to a collection of algorithms built upon the eigenvalues (resp. singular values) and eigenvectors (resp. singular vectors) of some properly designed matrices constructed from data. A diverse array of applications have been found in machine learning, data science, and signal processing. Due to their simplicity and effectiveness, spectral methods are not only used as a stand-alone estimator, but also frequently employed to initialize other more sophisticated algorithms to improve performance. 
While the studies of spectral methods can be traced back to classical matrix perturbation theory and methods of moments, the past decade has witnessed tremendous theoretical advances in demystifying their efficacy through the lens of statistical modeling, with the aid of non-asymptotic random matrix theory. This monograph aims to present a systematic, comprehensive, yet accessible introduction to spectral methods from a modern statistical perspective, highlighting their algorithmic implications in diverse large-scale applications. In particular, our exposition gravitates around several central questions that span various applications: how to characterize the sample efficiency of spectral methods in reaching a target level of statistical accuracy, and how to assess their stability in the face of random noise, missing data, and adversarial corruptions? In addition to conventional $\ell_2$ perturbation analysis, we present a systematic $\ell_{\infty}$ and $\ell_{2,\infty}$ perturbation theory for eigenspace and singular subspaces, which has only recently become available owing to a powerful ""leave-one-out"" analysis framework.",566-806,10.1561/2200000079,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d6adb9636df5a8a5dbcbfaecd0c4d34d7c85034,118,2020-12-15

Furthermore, the data is standardized such that analysis done at Stanford can be replicated elsewhere using the same analytical code and clinical concepts. Finally, the analytics data warehouse integrates with a secure data science computational facility to support large scale data analytics. The ecosystem is designed to bring the modern data science community to highly sensitive clinical data in a secure and collaborative big data analytics environment with a goal to enable bigger, better and faster science.",83-180,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b9ea2abf1c5a04b3024367409284edceb741ef2,61,2020-03-17

The analysis was performed on novel data science methods in four individual classes of deep learning models, hybrid deep learning models, hybrid machine learning, and ensemble models. Application domains include a wide and diverse range of economics research from the stock market, marketing, and e-commerce to corporate banking and cryptocurrency. Prisma method, a systematic literature review methodology, was used to ensure the quality of the survey. The findings reveal that the trends follow the advancement of hybrid models, which, based on the accuracy metric, outperform other learning algorithms.

It may seem that whether a system works is a function of its technical design, but it is also accomplished through ongoing forms of discretionary work by many actors. Based on six months of ethnographic fieldwork with a corporate data science team, we describe how actors involved in a corporate project negotiated what work the system should do, how it should work, and how to assess whether it works. These negotiations laid the foundation for how, why, and to what extent the system ultimately worked. We describe three main findings. First, how already-existing technologies are essential reference points to determine how and whether systems work. Second, how the situated resolution of development challenges continually reshapes the understanding of how and whether systems work. Third, how business goals, and especially their negotiated balance with data science imperatives, affect a system’s working. We conclude with takeaways for critical data studies, orienting researchers to focus on the organizational and cultural aspects of data science, the third-party platforms underlying data science systems, and ways to engage with practitioners’ imagination of how systems can and should work.",21-104,10.1177/2053951720939605,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/648ba966b63975c6859e1948ae3ddc30053884e4,51,2020-07-01

These changes will unlikely stop or even decelerate in the near future. There is an urgent need for a new scientific approach and an advanced form of evidence-based decision-making towards the benefit of society, the economy, and the environment. To understand the impacts and interrelationships between humans as a society and natural Earth system processes, we propose a new engineering discipline, Big Earth Data science. This science is called to provide the methodologies and tools to generate knowledge from diverse, numerous, and complex data sources necessary to ensure a sustainable human society essential for the preservation of planet Earth. Big Earth Data science aims at utilizing data from Earth observation and social sensing and develop theories for understanding the mechanisms of how such a social-physical system operates and evolves. The manuscript introduces the universe of discourse characterizing this new science, its foundational paradigms and methodologies, and a possible technological framework to be implemented by applying an ecosystem approach. CASEarth and GEOSS are presented as examples of international implementation attempts.

One application domain is data science. New techniques in automating the creation of AI, known as AutoAI or AutoML, aim to automate the work practices of data scientists. AutoAI systems are capable of autonomously ingesting and pre-processing data, engineering new features, and creating and scoring models based on a target objectives (e.g. accuracy or run-time efficiency). Though not yet widely adopted, we are interested in understanding how AutoAI will impact the practice of data science. We conducted interviews with 20 data scientists who work at a large, multinational technology company and practice data science in various business settings. Our goal is to understand their current work practices and how these practices might change with AutoAI. Reactions were mixed: while informants expressed concerns about the trend of automating their jobs, they also strongly felt it was inevitable. Despite these concerns, they remained optimistic about their future job security due to a view that the future of data science work will be a collaboration between humans and AI systems, in which both automation and human expertise are indispensable.",1 - 24,10.1145/3359313,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8ece479b5dfed4727d2d9b9763f777bb9a94096e,217,2019-09-05

Data science is often described as data-driven, comprising unambiguous data and proceeding through regularized steps of analysis. However, this view focuses more on abstract processes, pipelines, and workflows, and less on how data science workers engage with the data. In this paper, we build on the work of other CSCW and HCI researchers in describing the ways that scientists, scholars, engineers, and others work with their data, through analyses of interviews with 21 data science professionals. We set five approaches to data along a dimension of interventions: Data as given; as captured; as curated; as designed; and as created. Data science workers develop an intuitive sense of their data and processes, and actively shape their data. We propose new ways to apply these interventions analytically, to make sense of the complex activities around data practices.",51-172,10.1145/3290605.3300356,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/398b154013db9d8025bf60f910bc156dedd9b40e,195,2019-05-02
a11e157cb828b800426223f0a3d79e8fb122c8cc,Process Mining for Python (PM4Py): Bridging the Gap Between Process- and Data Science,"Process mining, i.e., a sub-field of data science focusing on the analysis of event data generated during the execution of (business) processes, has seen a tremendous change over the past two decades. Starting off in the early 2000's, with limited to no tool support, nowadays, several software tools, i.e., both open-source, e.g., ProM and Apromore, and commercial, e.g., Disco, Celonis, ProcessGold, etc., exist. The commercial process mining tools provide limited support for implementing custom algorithms. Moreover, both commercial and open-source process mining tools are often only accessible through a graphical user interface, which hampers their usage in large-scale experimental settings. Initiatives such as RapidProM provide process mining support in the scientific workflow-based data science suite RapidMiner. However, these offer limited to no support for algorithmic customization. In the light of the aforementioned, in this paper, we present a novel process mining library, i.e. Process Mining for Python (PM4Py) that aims to bridge this gap, providing integration with state-of-the-art data science libraries, e.g., pandas, numpy, scipy and scikit-learn.

However, there does not appear to be a consensus on the fundamental principles, expertise, skills, or knowledge-base needed to define an academic discipline. We argue that data science is not a discipline but rather an umbrella term used to describe a complex process involving not one data scientist possessing all the necessary expertise, but a team of data scientists with nonoverlapping complementary skills. We provide some recommendations for how to take this into account when designing data science academic programs.Keywords: applied statistics, data science, data science curriculum, data wrangling, machine learning, software engineering",54-171,10.1162/99608f92.dd363929,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/41cf91ee13a1d15983ede066ddf6b67cc94a41f4,36,2020-01-31

In the time since, individuals with training in both computing and statistics have become increasingly employable in the burgeoning data science field. In response, universities have developed new courses and programs to meet the growing demand for data science education. To address this demand, we created Data Science in Practice, a large-enrollment undergraduate course. Here, we present our goals for teaching this course, including: (1) conceptualizing data science as creative problem solving, with a focus on project-based learning, (2) prioritizing practical application, teaching and using standardized tools and best practices, and (3) scaling education through coursework that enables hands-on and classroom learning in a large-enrollment course. Throughout this course we also emphasize social context and data ethics to best prepare students for the interdisciplinary and impactful nature of their work. We highlight creative problem solving and strategies for teaching automation-resilient skills, while providing students the opportunity to create a unique data science project that demonstrates their technical and creative capacities.",S27 - S39,10.1080/10691898.2020.1860725,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/840b60da93c2776230d3e6123d708e1c7e66ebc0,37,2020-12-15

27b9d1182e913decc7ef6a3509245fa6b6fd509d,Veridical data science,"Significance Predictability, computability, and stability (PCS) are three core principles of data science. They embed the scientific principles of prediction and replication in data-driven decision making while recognizing the central role of computation. Based on these principles, we propose the PCS framework, including workflow and documentation (in R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook). The PCS framework aims at responsible, reliable, reproducible, and transparent analysis across fields of science, social science, engineering, business, and government. It can be used as a recommendation system for scientific hypothesis generation and experimental design. In particular, we propose (basic) PCS inference for reliability measures on data results, extending statistical inference to a much broader scope as current data science practice entails. Building and expanding on principles of statistics, machine learning, and scientific inquiry, we propose the predictability, computability, and stability (PCS) framework for veridical data science. Our framework, composed of both a workflow and documentation, aims to provide responsible, reliable, reproducible, and transparent results across the data science life cycle. The PCS workflow uses predictability as a reality check and considers the importance of computation in data collection/storage and algorithm design. It augments predictability and computability with an overarching stability principle. Stability expands on statistical uncertainty considerations to assess how human judgment calls impact data results through data and model/algorithm perturbations. As part of the PCS workflow, we develop PCS inference procedures, namely PCS perturbation intervals and PCS hypothesis testing, to investigate the stability of data results relative to problem formulation, data cleaning, modeling decisions, and interpretations. We illustrate PCS inference through neuroscience and genomics projects of our own and others. Moreover, we demonstrate its favorable performance over existing methods in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in high-dimensional, sparse linear model simulations, including a wide range of misspecified models. Finally, we propose PCS documentation based on R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook, with publicly available, reproducible codes and narratives to back up human choices made throughout an analysis. The PCS workflow and documentation are demonstrated in a genomics case study available on Zenodo.",3920 - 3929,10.1073/pnas.1901326117,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27b9d1182e913decc7ef6a3509245fa6b6fd509d,117,2019-01-23

f56425ec56586dcfd2694ab83643e9e76f314e91,50 Years of Data Science,"ABSTRACT More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In “The Future of Data Analysis,” he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or “data analysis.” Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name “data science” for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of “data science” programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a $100M “Data Science Initiative” that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as “cultural appropriation.” This article reviews some ingredients of the current “data science moment,” including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for “scaling up” to “big data.” This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere “scaling up,” but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are “learning from data,” and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today’s data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.

Effective response to such outbreaks relies on timely intervention, ideally informed by all available sources of data. The collection, visualization and analysis of outbreak data are becoming increasingly complex, owing to the diversity in types of data, questions and available methods to address them. Recent advances have led to the rise of outbreak analytics, an emerging data science focused on the technological and methodological aspects of the outbreak data pipeline, from collection to analysis, modelling and reporting to inform outbreak response. In this article, we assess the current state of the field. After laying out the context of outbreak response, we critically review the most common analytics components, their inter-dependencies, data requirements and the type of information they can provide to inform operations in real time. We discuss some challenges and opportunities and conclude on the potential role of outbreak analytics for improving our understanding of, and response to outbreaks of emerging pathogens. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting and control‘. This theme issue is linked with the earlier issue ‘Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: approaches and important themes’.",79-186,10.1098/rstb.2018.0276,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/89f41c87c8849ce37e609c1010087291a4679a37,128,2019-05-20

Many people who currently teach data science are practitioners such as computational researchers in academia or data scientists in industry. To understand how these practitioner-instructors pass their knowledge onto novices and how that contrasts with teaching more traditional forms of programming, we interviewed 20 data scientists who teach in settings ranging from small-group workshops to large online courses. We found that: 1) they must empathize with a diverse array of student backgrounds and expectations, 2) they teach technical workflows that integrate authentic practices surrounding code, data, and communication, 3) they face challenges involving authenticity versus abstraction in software setup, finding and curating pedagogically-relevant datasets, and acclimating students to live with uncertainty in data analysis. These findings can point the way toward better tools for data science education and help bring data literacy to more people around the world.",74-163,10.1145/3290605.3300493,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ec4d0e29455e47245edaa17368257df3efb6562,61,2019-05-02

ML systems to execute these workloads include numerical computing frameworks and libraries, ML algorithm libraries, and specialized systems for deep neural networks and distributed ML. These systems focus primarily on efficient model training and scoring. However, the data science process is exploratory, and deals with underspecified objectives and a wide variety of heterogeneous data sources. Therefore, additional tools are employed for data engineering and debugging, which requires boundary crossing, unnecessary manual effort, and lacks optimization across the lifecycle. In this paper, we introduce SystemDS, an open source ML system for the end-to-end data science lifecycle from data integration, cleaning, and preparation, over local, distributed, and federated ML model training, to debugging and serving. To this end, we aim to provide a stack of declarative languages with R-like syntax for the different lifecycle tasks, and users with different expertise. We describe the overall system architecture, explain major design decisions (motivated by lessons learned from Apache SystemML), and discuss key features and research directions. Finally, we provide preliminary results that show the potential of end-to-end lifecycle optimization.",22-153,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ad13329d44c74041626a60898ccf921b0bdacd3,48,2019-09-06

This is a fast moving field, drawing principles and techniques from a number of different disciplinary areas including computer science, statistics and complexity science. Data science is having a profound impact on a number of areas including commerce, health and smart cities. This paper argues that data science can have an equal if not greater impact in the area of earth and environmental sciences, offering a rich tapestry of new techniques to support both a deeper understanding of the natural environment in all its complexities, as well as the development of well-founded mitigation and adaptation strategies in the face of climate change. The paper argues that data science for the natural environment brings about new challenges for data science, particularly around complexity, spatial and temporal reasoning, and managing uncertainty.

Along with these changes in society, powerful new data science methods support research using administrative, internet, textual, and sensor-audio-video data. Burgeoning data and innovative methods facilitate answering previously hard-to-tackle questions about society by offering new ways to form concepts from data, to do descriptive inference, to make causal inferences, and to generate predictions. They also pose challenges as social scientists must grasp the meaning of concepts and predictions generated by convoluted algorithms, weigh the relative value of prediction versus causal inference, and cope with ethical challenges as their methods, such as algorithms for mobilizing voters or determining bail, are adopted by policy makers.",33-177,10.1146/ANNUREV-POLISCI-090216-023229,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e23ff1f915b6af32bf1a1107ee7e15ebe10efe8,47,2019-05-11

Data librarianship has its origins in the social sciences. In particular, the creation of data services and data archives, in the United Kingdom (Data Archives Services) and in the United States and Canada (Data Library Services), is a key factor for the emergence of data librarianship. The focus of data librarianship nowadays is on the creation of new library services. Data librarians are concerned with the proposition of services for data management and curation in academic libraries and other research organizations. The purpose of this paper is to understand how the complexity of the data can serve as the basis for identifying the technical skills required by data librarians. This essay is systematically divided, first introducing the concepts of data and research data in data librarianship, followed by an overview of data science as a theory, method, and technology to assess data. Next, the identification of the competencies and skills required by data scientists and data librarians are discussed. Our final remarks highlight that data librarians should understand that the complexity and novelty associated with data science praxis. Data science provides new methods and practices for data librarianship. A data librarian need not become a programmer, statistician, or database manager, but should be interested in learning about the languages and programming logic of computers, databases, and information retrieval tools. We believe that numerous kinds of scientific data research provide opportunities for a data librarian to engage with data science.",771 - 780,10.1177/0961000617742465,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e564e3656395782d0ab9f801bfbe9f9f1a5d34a7,50,2019-09-01

Storing and analyzing these data to implement precision medicine initiatives and data-driven research has exceeded the capabilities of traditional computer systems. Modern big data platforms must be adapted to the specific demands of health care and designed for scalability and growth. Objective The objectives of our study were to (1) demonstrate the implementation of a data science platform built on open source technology within a large, academic health care system and (2) describe 2 computational health care applications built on such a platform. Methods We deployed a data science platform based on several open source technologies to support real-time, big data workloads. We developed data-acquisition workflows for Apache Storm and NiFi in Java and Python to capture patient monitoring and laboratory data for downstream analytics. Results Emerging data management approaches, along with open source technologies such as Hadoop, can be used to create integrated data lakes to store large, real-time datasets. This infrastructure also provides a robust analytics platform where health care and biomedical research data can be analyzed in near real time for precision medicine and computational health care use cases. Conclusions The implementation and use of integrated data science platforms offer organizations the opportunity to combine traditional datasets, including data from the electronic health record, with emerging big data sources, such as continuous patient monitoring and real-time laboratory results. These platforms can enable cost-effective and scalable analytics for the information that will be key to the delivery of precision medicine initiatives.

This has led to over a decade of calls to establish a corresponding field of Data Science Education. There is still a need, however, to more deeply conceptualize what a field of Data Science Education might entail in terms of scope, responsibility, and execution. This special issue explores how one distinguishing feature of Data Science—its focus on data collected from social and environmental contexts within which learners often find themselves deeply embedded—suggests serious implications for learning and education. The learning sciences is uniquely positioned to investigate how such contextual embeddings impact learners’ engagement with data including conceptual, experiential, communal, racialized, spatial, and political dimensions. This special issue demonstrates the richly layered relationships learners build with data and reveals them to be not merely utilitarian mechanisms for learning about data, but a critical part of navigating data as social text and understanding Data Science as a discipline.

While case studies on these cities provide valuable insights, comparability and scalability remain sidelined. It is therefore timely to review the state-of-the-art in data infrastructures, including earth observations, social media data, and how they could be better integrated to advance climate change science in cities and urban areas. We present three routes for expanding knowledge on global urban areas: mainstreaming data collections, amplifying the use of big data and taking further advantage of computational methods to analyse qualitative data to gain new insights. These data-based approaches have the potential to upscale urban climate solutions and effect change at the global scale. Technical summary Cities have an increasingly integral role in addressing climate change. To gain a common understanding of solutions, we require adequate and representative data of urban areas, including data on related greenhouse gas emissions, climate threats and of socio-economic contexts. Here, we review the current state of urban data science in the context of climate change, investigating the contribution of urban metabolism studies, remote sensing, big data approaches, urban economics, urban climate and weather studies. We outline three routes for upscaling urban data science for global climate solutions: 1) Mainstreaming and harmonizing data collection in cities worldwide; 2) Exploiting big data and machine learning to scale solutions while maintaining privacy; 3) Applying computational techniques and data science methods to analyse published qualitative information for the systematization and understanding of first-order climate effects and solutions.

However, academic statistics has often frowned upon data analyses with a causal objective. The introduction of the term ""data science"" provides a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in such a way that it naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we organize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks: Description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science. Specifically, causal analyses typically require not only good data and algorithms, but also domain expert knowledge.

With advances in IoT and the ubiquity of smart connected sensors to collect movement and contextual data, we now have access to a wealth of geo-enriched high-resolution tracking data. These data promise new forms of knowledge and insight into movement of humans, animals, and goods, and hence can increase our understanding of complex spatiotemporal processes such as disease outbreak, urban mobility, migration, and human-species interaction.

b85ac20631159ca3e370afa9c1f81a4618242b4f,The Democratization of Data Science Education,"Abstract Over the last three decades, data have become ubiquitous and cheap. This transition has accelerated over the last five years and training in statistics, machine learning, and data analysis has struggled to keep up. In April 2014, we launched a program of nine courses, the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization, which has now had more than 4 million enrollments over the past five years. Here, the program is described and compared to standard data science curricula as they were organized in 2014 and 2015. We show that novel pedagogical and administrative decisions introduced in our program are now standard in online data science programs. The impact of the Data Science Specialization on data science education in the U.S. is also discussed. Finally, we conclude with some thoughts about the future of data science education in a data democratized world.",1 - 7,10.1080/00031305.2019.1668849,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b85ac20631159ca3e370afa9c1f81a4618242b4f,30,2019-10-28

31de1d23b2f1f1c14ce7025489d2892aa10fb1ef,A review of data science in business and industry and a future view,"The aim of this paper is to frame Data Science, a fashion and emerging topic nowadays in the context of business and industry. We open with a discussion about the origin of Data Science, and its requirement for a challenging mix of capability in data analytics, information technology and business know-how. The mission of Data Science is to provide new or revised computational theory able to extract useful information from the massive volumes of data collected at an accelerating pace. In fact, besides the traditional measurements, digital data obtained from images, text, audio, sensors, etc complement the survey. Then we review the different and most popular methodologies amongst the practitioners of Data Science research and applications. And since the emerging field requires personnel with new competences, we attempt to describe the Data Scientist profile, one of the sexiest jobs of the 21st Century according to Davenport and Patil. Most people are aware of the need to embrace Data Science, but they feel intimidated that they don’t understand it and they worry that their jobs will disappear. We want to encourage them: Data Science is more likely to add value to jobs and enrich the lives of working people by helping them make better, more informed business decisions. We conclude the paper by presenting examples of Data Science in action in business and industry, to demonstrate the collection of specialist skills that must come together for this new science to be effective.",61-179,10.1002/asmb.2488,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/31de1d23b2f1f1c14ce7025489d2892aa10fb1ef,24,2019-10-29

Purpose
Data science is a relatively new field which has gained considerable attention in recent years. This new field requires a wide range of knowledge and skills from different disciplines including mathematics and statistics, computer science and information science. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the study that explored the field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective.


Design/methodology/approach
Analysis of research publications on data science was made on the basis of papers published in the Web of Science database. The following research questions were proposed: What are the main tendencies in publication years, document types, countries of origin, source titles, authors of publications, affiliations of the article authors and the most cited articles related to data science in the field of LIS? What are the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective?


Findings
The highest contribution to data science comes from the computer science research community. The contribution of information science and library science community is quite small. However, there has been continuous increase in articles from the year 2015. The main document types are journal articles, followed by conference proceedings and editorial material. The top three journals that publish data science papers from the LIS perspective are the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the International Journal of Information Management and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. The top five countries publishing are USA, China, England, Australia and India. The most cited article has got 112 citations. The analysis revealed that the data science field is quite interdisciplinary by nature. In addition to the field of LIS the papers belonged to several other research areas. The reviewed articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences.


Research limitations/implications
The limitations of this research are that this study only analyzed research papers in the Web of Science database and therefore only covers a certain amount of scientific papers published in the field of LIS. In addition, only publications with the term “data science” in the topic area of the Web of Science database were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that are not reflected in the Web of Science database or were related to other keywords such as “e-science,” “e-research,” “data service,” “data curation” or “research data management.”


Originality/value
The field of data science has not been explored using bibliographic analysis of publications from the perspective of the LIS. This paper helps to better understand the field of data science and the perspectives for information professionals.

The idea that these values should be central to the practice of data science is increasingly gaining traction, yet there is no agreement on what exactly makes data science responsible or sustainable because these concepts prove slippery when applied to a global field involving commercial, academic and governmental actors. This lack of clarity is causing problems in setting goals and boundaries for data scientific practice, and risks fundamental disagreement on governance principles for this emerging field. We will argue in this commentary for a commons analytical framework as one approach to this problem, since it offers useful signposts for how to establish governance principles for shared resources.",49-182,10.1177/2053951719858114,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36708c11c2fde2efb50e75d81f174b2c205082c8,23,2019-07-01

The demand for support in data science literacy is outpacing available resources at college campuses. The academic library is uniquely positioned to provide training and guidance in a number of areas relevant to data science. The University of Arizona Libraries has built a successful data science support program, focusing on computational literacy, geographic information systems, and reproducible science. Success of the program has largely been due to the strength of library personnel and strategic partnerships with units outside of the library. Academic libraries can support campus data science needs through professional development of current staff and recruitment of new personnel with expertise in data-intensive domains.",241 - 257,10.1080/01930826.2019.1583015,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4aeda303fa0b9beae3f6d65e052dace9d4540116,20,2019-03-20

We define data science as a dual shift which involves both bringing in new decision making and analytical techniques to local government work (e.g. machine learning and predictive analytics, artificial intelligence and A/B testing) and also expanding the types of data local government makes use of (for example, by repurposing administrative data, harvesting social media data, or working with mobile phone companies). The emergence of data science is facilitated by the growing availability of free, open-source tools for both collecting data and performing analysis. Based on extensive documentary review, a nationwide survey of local authorities, and in-depth interviews with over 30 practitioners, we have sought to produce a comprehensive guide to the different types of data science being undertaken in the UK, the types of opportunities and benefits created, and also some of the challenges and difficulties being encountered. Our aim was to provide a basis for people working in local government to start on their own data science projects, both by providing a library of dozens of ideas which have been tried elsewhere and also by providing hints and tips for overcoming key problems and challenges.",53-101,10.2139/ssrn.3370217,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08468bac470e5c2cbbd2b66e8e7cf2ab65f38e02,19,2019-03-01

Theory-guided data science (TGDS) is an emerging paradigm that aims to leverage the wealth of scientific knowledge for improving the effectiveness of data science models in enabling scientific discovery. The overarching vision of TGDS is to introduce scientific consistency as an essential component for learning generalizable models. Further, by producing scientifically interpretable models, TGDS aims to advance our scientific understanding by discovering novel domain insights. Indeed, the paradigm of TGDS has started to gain prominence in a number of scientific disciplines such as turbulence modeling, material discovery, quantum chemistry, bio-medical science, bio-marker discovery, climate science, and hydrology. In this paper, we formally conceptualize the paradigm of TGDS and present a taxonomy of research themes in TGDS. We describe several approaches for integrating domain knowledge in different research themes using illustrative examples from different disciplines. We also highlight some of the promising avenues of novel research for realizing the full potential of theory-guided data science.",2318-2331,10.1109/TKDE.2017.2720168,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e1c8f86668d3e37e430f187b7fd91d1643a0a0ff,766,2016-12-27

ffdb6039a5d82f8edd70b2d177074c2f2c89e97f,Data Science as Political Action: Grounding Data Science in a Politics of Justice,"In response to recent controversies, the field of data science has rushed to adopt codes of ethics. Such professional codes, however, are ill-equipped to address broad matters of social justice. Instead of ethics codes, I argue, the field must embrace politics. Data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors engaged in normative constructions of society and, as befits political work, evaluate their work according to its downstream material impacts on people's lives. I justify this notion in two parts: first, by articulating why data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors, and second, by describing how the field can evolve toward a deliberative and rigorous grounding in a politics of social justice. Part 1 responds to three arguments that are commonly invoked by data scientists when they are challenged to take political positions regarding their work. In confronting these arguments, I will demonstrate why attempting to remain apolitical is itself a political stance--a fundamentally conservative one--and why the field's current attempts to promote ""social good"" dangerously rely on vague and unarticulated political assumptions. Part 2 proposes a framework for what a politically-engaged data science could look like and how to achieve it, recognizing the challenge of reforming the field in this manner. I conceptualize the process of incorporating politics into data science in four stages: becoming interested in directly addressing social issues, recognizing the politics underlying these issues, redirecting existing methods toward new applications, and, finally, developing new practices and methods that orient data science around a mission of social justice. The path ahead does not require data scientists to abandon their technical expertise, but it does entail expanding their notions of what problems to work on and how to engage with society.",249-265,10.23919/JSC.2021.0029,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ffdb6039a5d82f8edd70b2d177074c2f2c89e97f,93,2018-11-06

In today’s world, organizations recognize the vital role of data in modern business intelligence systems for making meaningful decisions and staying competitive in the field. Efficient and optimal data analytics provides a competitive edge to its performance and services. Major organizations generate, collect and process vast amounts of data, falling under the category of big data. Managing and analyzing the sheer volume and variety of big data is a cumbersome process. At the same time, proper utilization of the vast collection of an organization’s information can generate meaningful insights into business tactics. In this regard, two of the popular data management systems in the area of big data analytics (i.e., data warehouse and data lake) act as platforms to accumulate the big data generated and used by organizations. Although seemingly similar, both of them differ in terms of their characteristics and applications. This article presents a detailed overview of the roles of data warehouses and data lakes in modern enterprise data management.

With the aim to face the COVID-19 data collection, harmonization and integration problems, we present the design and development of COVID-WAREHOUSE, a data warehouse that models, integrates and stores the COVID-19 data made available daily by the Italian Protezione Civile Department and several pollution and climate data made available by the Italian Regions. After an automatic ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Loading) step, COVID-19 cases, pollution measures and climate data, are integrated and organized using the Dimensional Fact Model, using two main dimensions: time and geographical location. COVID-WAREHOUSE supports OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) analysis, provides a heatmap visualizer, and allows easy extraction of selected data for further analysis. The proposed tool can be used in the context of Public Health to underline how the pandemic is spreading, with respect to time and geographical location, and to correlate the pandemic to pollution and climate data in a specific region. Moreover, public decision-makers could use the tool to discover combinations of pollution and climate conditions correlated to an increase of the pandemic, and thus, they could act in a consequent manner. Case studies based on data cubes built on data from Lombardia and Puglia regions are discussed. Our preliminary findings indicate that COVID-19 pandemic is significantly spread in regions characterized by high concentration of particulate in the air and the absence of rain and wind, as even stated in other works available in literature.",100-196,10.3390/ijerph17155596,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63288534c93f8854a34e5511d9171c5f71ec2886,26,2020-08-01

00a2aeb87287d59eaf118e96f0cdbb622a7fec42,The Snowflake Elastic Data Warehouse,"We live in the golden age of distributed computing. Public cloud platforms now offer virtually unlimited compute and storage resources on demand. At the same time, the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model brings enterprise-class systems to users who previously could not afford such systems due to their cost and complexity. Alas, traditional data warehousing systems are struggling to fit into this new environment. For one thing, they have been designed for fixed resources and are thus unable to leverage the cloud's elasticity. For another thing, their dependence on complex ETL pipelines and physical tuning is at odds with the flexibility and freshness requirements of the cloud's new types of semi-structured data and rapidly evolving workloads. We decided a fundamental redesign was in order. Our mission was to build an enterprise-ready data warehousing solution for the cloud. The result is the Snowflake Elastic Data Warehouse, or ""Snowflake"" for short. Snowflake is a multi-tenant, transactional, secure, highly scalable and elastic system with full SQL support and built-in extensions for semi-structured and schema-less data. The system is offered as a pay-as-you-go service in the Amazon cloud. Users upload their data to the cloud and can immediately manage and query it using familiar tools and interfaces. Implementation began in late 2012 and Snowflake has been generally available since June 2015. Today, Snowflake is used in production by a growing number of small and large organizations alike. The system runs several million queries per day over multiple petabytes of data. In this paper, we describe the design of Snowflake and its novel multi-cluster, shared-data architecture. The paper highlights some of the key features of Snowflake: extreme elasticity and availability, semi-structured and schema-less data, time travel, and end-to-end security. It concludes with lessons learned and an outlook on ongoing work.",16-160,10.1145/2882903.2903741,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00a2aeb87287d59eaf118e96f0cdbb622a7fec42,222,2016-06-14

Clinical research data warehouses for specific cancer types can enable the creation of more robust research cohorts. Methods: We linked data from the Stanford University EHR with the Stanford Cancer Institute Research Database (SCIRDB) and the California Cancer Registry (CCR) to create a research data warehouse for prostate cancer. The database was supplemented with information from clinical trials, natural language processing of clinical notes and surveys on patient-reported outcomes. Results: 11,898 unique prostate cancer patients were identified in the Stanford EHR, of which 3,936 were matched to the Stanford cancer registry and 6153 in the CCR. 7158 patients with EHR data and at least one of SCIRDB and CCR data were initially included in the warehouse.

Some conclude that Data Warehouse as such will disappear; others present Big Data as the natural Data Warehouse evolution (perhaps without identifying a clear division between the two); and finally, some others pose a future of convergence, partially exploring the possible integration of both. In this paper, we revise the underlying technological features of Big Data and Data Warehouse, highlighting their differences and areas of convergence. Even when some differences exist, both technologies could (and should) be integrated because they both aim at the same purpose: data exploration and decision making support. We explore some convergence strategies, based on the common elements in both technologies. We present a revision of the state-of-the-art in integration proposals from the point of view of the purpose, methodology, architecture and underlying technology, highlighting the common elements that support both technologies that may serve as a starting point for full integration and we propose a proposal of integration between the two technologies.",1-17,10.5121/IJCSIT.2017.9201,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e61b4479872ed8dbbea3786a17072fdd5c31f10a,22,2017-04-01

Usually, an organization summarizes and copies information from its operational systems to the data warehouse on a regular schedule and management performs complex queries and analysis on the information without slowing down the operational systems. Data need to be pre-processed to improve quality of data, before storing into data warehouse. This survey paper presents data cleaning problems and the approaches in use currently for preprocessing. To determine which technique of preprocessing is best in what scenario to improve the performance of Data Warehouse is main goal of this paper. Many techniques have been analyzed for data cleansing, using certain evaluation attributes and tested on different kind of data sets. Data quality tools such as YALE, ALTERYX, and WEKA have been used for conclusive results to ready the data in data warehouse and ensure that only cleaned data populates the warehouse, thus enhancing usability of the warehouse. Results of paper can be useful in many future activities like cleansing, standardizing, correction, matching and transformation. This research can help in data auditing and pattern detection in the data.",50-61,10.5815/IJITCS.2017.03.06,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3dfef91427af4649632d527f92775d34cb1b95a5,21,2017-03-08

To meet this need, the authors have built a robust and scalable data mart based on their implementation of EPIC containing data from across the perioperative period. The data mart is structured in such a way so as to first simplify the overall EPIC reporting structure into a series of Base Tables and then create several Reporting Schemas each around a specific concept (operating room cases, obstetrics, hospital admission, etc.), which contain all of the data required for reporting on various metrics. This structure allows centralized definitions with simplified reporting by a large number of individuals who access only the Reporting Schemas. In creating the database, the authors were able to significantly reduce the number of required table identifiers from >10 to 3, as well as to correct errors in linkages affecting up to 18.4% of cases. In addition, the data mart greatly simplified the code required to extract data, making the data accessible to individuals who lacked a strong coding background.

Besides, unstructured content, e.g., emails and documents, constitutes more than half of the entire enterprise data and contains a lot of implicit knowledge about warehouse entities. Thus, holistic ana-lytics require the integration of structured warehouse data and unstructured content to generate novel insights. These insights can also be used to enrich the integrated data and to create a new basis for further analytics. Existing integration approaches only support a limited range of analytical applications and require the costly adaptation of the warehouse schema. In this paper, we present the Deep Data Warehouse (DeepDWH), a novel type of data warehouse based on the flexible integration and enrichment of warehouse data and unstructured content, addressing the variety challenge of Big Data. It relies on information-rich in-stance-level links between warehouse elements and content items, which are represented in a graph-oriented structure. Neither adaptations of the existing warehouse nor the design of an overall federated schema are required. We design a conceptual linking model and develop a logical schema for links based on a property graph.

In the retailing industry, this technique is used to extract the consumers buying behaviour when customers frequently purchase similar products together; in warehousing, it is also beneficial to store these correlated products nearby so as to reduce the order picking operating time and cost. In this paper, we present a data mining-based algorithm for storage location assignment of piece picking items in a randomised picker-to-parts warehouse by extracting and analysing the association relationships between different products in customer orders. The algorithm aims at minimising the total travel distances for both put-away and order picking operations. Extensive computational experiments based on synthetic data that simulates the operations of a computer and networking products spare parts warehouse in Hong Kong have been conducted to test the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm. Results show that our proposed algorithm is more efficient than the closest open location and purely dedicated storage allocation systems in minimising the total travel distances. The proposed storage allocation algorithm is further evaluated with experiments simulating larger scale warehouse operations. Similar results on the performance comparison among the three storage approaches are observed. It supports the proposed storage allocation algorithm and is applicable to improve the warehousing operation efficiency if items have strong association among each other.",4035 - 4052,10.1080/00207543.2016.1244615,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fefe278128fadba4a63baa9b8479d2740fa0e0f3,63,2017-07-18

To functionally annotate newly sequenced microbial genomes, a variety of experimental and computational methods are used. Integration of information from different sources is a powerful approach to enhance such annotation. Functional analysis of microbial genomes, necessary for downstream experiments, crucially depends on this annotation but it is hampered by the current lack of suitable information integration and exploration systems for microbial genomes. Results We developed a data warehouse system (INDIGO) that enables the integration of annotations for exploration and analysis of newly sequenced microbial genomes. INDIGO offers an opportunity to construct complex queries and combine annotations from multiple sources starting from genomic sequence to protein domain, gene ontology and pathway levels. This data warehouse is aimed at being populated with information from genomes of pure cultures and uncultured single cells of Red Sea bacteria and Archaea. Currently, INDIGO contains information from Salinisphaera shabanensis, Haloplasma contractile, and Halorhabdus tiamatea - extremophiles isolated from deep-sea anoxic brine lakes of the Red Sea. We provide examples of utilizing the system to gain new insights into specific aspects on the unique lifestyle and adaptations of these organisms to extreme environments. Conclusions We developed a data warehouse system, INDIGO, which enables comprehensive integration of information from various resources to be used for annotation, exploration and analysis of microbial genomes. It will be regularly updated and extended with new genomes. It is aimed to serve as a resource dedicated to the Red Sea microbes. In addition, through INDIGO, we provide our Automatic Annotation of Microbial Genomes (AAMG) pipeline.

7ea56351817ae57f93fd6a04c58539fdf9759ec7,Data warehouse testing,"During the development of the data warehouse (DW), too much data is transformed, integrated, structured, cleansed, and grouped in a single structure that is the DW. These various types of changes could lead to data corruption or data manipulation. Therefore, DW testing is a very critical stage in the DW development process.
 A number of attempts were made to describe how the testing process should take place in the DW environment. In this paper, I will state briefly these testing approaches, and then a proposed matrix will be used to evaluate and compare these approaches. Afterwards, I will highlight the weakness points that exist in the available DW testing approaches.

4c7bfa933c11c7a802c2fa9c1dc475dba36a2bd5,Hive - a petabyte scale data warehouse using Hadoop,"The size of data sets being collected and analyzed in the industry for business intelligence is growing rapidly, making traditional warehousing solutions prohibitively expensive. Hadoop [1] is a popular open-source map-reduce implementation which is being used in companies like Yahoo, Facebook etc. to store and process extremely large data sets on commodity hardware. However, the map-reduce programming model is very low level and requires developers to write custom programs which are hard to maintain and reuse. In this paper, we present Hive, an open-source data warehousing solution built on top of Hadoop. Hive supports queries expressed in a SQL-like declarative language - HiveQL, which are compiled into map-reduce jobs that are executed using Hadoop. In addition, HiveQL enables users to plug in custom map-reduce scripts into queries. The language includes a type system with support for tables containing primitive types, collections like arrays and maps, and nested compositions of the same. The underlying IO libraries can be extended to query data in custom formats. Hive also includes a system catalog - Metastore - that contains schemas and statistics, which are useful in data exploration, query optimization and query compilation. In Facebook, the Hive warehouse contains tens of thousands of tables and stores over 700TB of data and is being used extensively for both reporting and ad-hoc analyses by more than 200 users per month.",996-1005,10.1109/ICDE.2010.5447738,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4c7bfa933c11c7a802c2fa9c1dc475dba36a2bd5,1004,2010-03-01
f2ec23bfa99e582f2f96d65d411e06666a5860a8,Tajo: A distributed data warehouse system on large clusters,"The increasing volumes of relational data let us find an alternative to cope with them. Recently, several hybrid approaches (e.g., HadoopDB and Hive) between parallel databases and Hadoop have been introduced to the database community. Although these hybrid approaches have gained wide popularity, they cannot avoid the choice of suboptimal execution strategies. We believe that this problem is caused by the inherent limits of their architectures. In this demo, we present Tajo, a relational, distributed data warehouse system on shared-nothing clusters. It uses Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) as the storage layer and has its own query execution engine that we have developed instead of the MapReduce framework. A Tajo cluster consists of one master node and a number of workers across cluster nodes. The master is mainly responsible for query planning and the coordinator for workers. The master divides a query into small tasks and disseminates them to workers. Each worker has a local query engine that executes a directed acyclic graph of physical operators. A DAG of operators can take two or more input sources and be pipelined within the local query engine. In addition, Tajo can control distributed data flow more flexible than that of MapReduce and supports indexing techniques. By combining these features, Tajo can employ more optimized and efficient query processing, including the existing methods that have been studied in the traditional database research areas. To give a deep understanding of the Tajo architecture and behavior during query processing, the demonstration will allow users to submit TPC-H queries to 32 Tajo cluster nodes. The web-based user interface will show (1) how the submitted queries are planned, (2) how the query are distributed across nodes, (3) the cluster and node status, and (4) the detail of relations and their physical information. Also, we provide the performance evaluation of Tajo compared with Hive.",1320-1323,10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544934,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f2ec23bfa99e582f2f96d65d411e06666a5860a8,32,2013-04-08

This review examines the current state of the data warehouse governance literature as it applies to healthcare data warehouses, identifies knowledge gaps, provides recommendations, and suggests approaches for further research. Methods: A comprehensive literature search using five data bases, journal article title-search, and citation searches was conducted between 1997 and 2012. Data warehouse governance documents from two healthcare systems in the USA were also reviewed. A modified version of nine components from the Data Governance Institute Framework for data warehouse governance guided the qualitative analysis. Results: Fifteen articles were retrieved. Only three were related to healthcare settings, each of which addressed only one of the nine framework components. Of the remaining 12 articles, 10 addressed between one and seven framework components and the remainder addressed none. Each of the two data warehouse governance plans obtained from healthcare systems in the USA addressed a subset of the framework components, and between them they covered all nine. Conclusions: While published data warehouse governance policies are rare, the 15 articles and two healthcare organizational documents reviewed in this study may provide guidance to creating such policies. Additional research is needed in this area to ensure that data warehouse governance polices are feasible and effective. The gap between the development of data warehouses in healthcare settings and formal governance policies is substantial, as evidenced by the sparse literature in this domain.",30-164,10.13063/2327-9214.1010,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cca2b641ab7433209e7eb1e924e4ea31292a7477,23,2013-10-08

However, the development of related linked queries is still limited. This paper introduces an approach for matching frequently-used management tasks of GDBMS with concepts in Structured Query Language (SQL). An application programming interface (API) based on the Neo4j GDBMS was developed to enable functionalities needed with graph databases. Besides the API, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) was developed enabling the management and demonstration of graph datasets. Further, the concept ""graph cube"" is proposed as a design for integrating graphs with tables. The prototype combining these components constitutes the fundamental elements of a graph data warehouse.

4b190f29fdfd9d9c33491dccc9de7c24af9b74f7,A Data Warehouse Solution for Analyzing RFID-Based Baggage Tracking Data,"Today, airport baggage handling is far from perfect. Baggage goes on the wrong flights, is left behind, or gets lost, which costs a lot of money for the airlines, as well as frustration for the passengers. To remedy the situation, we present a data warehouse (DW) solution for storing and analyzing spatio-temporal Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) baggage tracking data. Analysis of this data can yield interesting results on baggage flow, the causes of baggage mishandling, and the parties responsible for the mishandling(airline, airport, handler,...), which can ultimately lead to improved baggage handling quality. The paper presents a carefully designed data warehouse (DW), with a relational schema sitting underneath a multidimensional data cube, that can handle the many complexities in the data. The paper also discusses the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) flow that loads the data warehouse with the appropriate tracking data from the data sources. The presented concepts are generalizable to other types of multi-site indoor tracking systems based on Bluetooth and RFID. The system has been tested with large amount of real-world RFID-based baggage tracking data from a major industry initiative. The developed solution is shown to both reveal interesting insights as well as being several orders of magnitude faster than computing the results directly on the data sources.",283-292,10.1109/MDM.2013.42,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b190f29fdfd9d9c33491dccc9de7c24af9b74f7,20,2013-06-03

de7cff83dfd2e7ffe6286f52adc13a76dbe16c67,A Data Warehouse Design for a Typical University Information System,"Presently, large enterprises rely on database systems to manage their data and information. These databases are useful for conducting daily business transactions. However, the tight competition in the marketplace has led to the concept of data mining in which data are analyzed to derive effective business strategies and discover better ways in carrying out business. In order to perform data mining, regular databases must be converted into what so called informational databases also known as data warehouse. This paper presents a design model for building data warehouse for a typical university information system. It is based on transforming an operational database into an informational warehouse useful for decision makers to conduct data analysis, predication, and forecasting. The proposed model is based on four stages of data migration: Data extraction, data cleansing, data transforming, and data indexing and loading. The complete system is implemented under MS Access 2010 and is meant to serve as a repository of data for data mining operations.",98-114,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/de7cff83dfd2e7ffe6286f52adc13a76dbe16c67,29,2012-12-10
c18a42a27ec5e2f7b9579267031d326a27fa6cb3,Materialised view construction in data warehouse for decision making,"A data warehouse contains historical and summarised data that grows, almost, exponentially with time. It provides a uniform platform for posing decision support queries. These queries are usually analytical and complex in nature and, when processed against a large data warehouse, consume a lot of processing time resulting in an increased query response time. This time can be reduced by using materialised views, which pre-compute the most frequently accessed information and stores them in a data warehouse. In this paper, an algorithm to construct materialised views using previously posed, optimal, user queries on the data warehouse, is proposed. This algorithm defines a heuristic that maximally merges the optimal queries to construct a single materialised view. These materialised views are capable of providing meaningful information for a given future query. Further, experiments are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the materialised views with respect to the query response time. The experimental results show that materialised views so constructed are capable of answering future user queries in a reduced response time. This would enable effective and efficient decision-making.",379-396,10.1504/IJBIS.2012.050172,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c18a42a27ec5e2f7b9579267031d326a27fa6cb3,29,2012-11-01

Although these codes provide optimal storage efficiency, they require significantly high network and disk usage during recovery of missing data. In this paper, we first present a study on the impact of recovery operations of erasure-coded data on the data-center network, based on measurements from Facebook's warehouse cluster in production. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind available in the literature. Our study reveals that recovery of RS-coded data results in a significant increase in network traffic, more than a hundred terabytes per day, in a cluster storing multiple petabytes of RS-coded data. 
To address this issue, we present a new storage code using our recently proposed ""Piggybacking"" framework, that reduces the network and disk usage during recovery by 30% in theory, while also being storage optimal and supporting arbitrary design parameters. The implementation of the proposed code in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is underway.

The demand for real-time data and contextual information is requried because of the highly customised orders, which tend to be of small batch size but with high variety. Since the orders frequently change according to customer requirements, the synchronisation of purchase orders to support production to ensure on-time order fulfilment is of high importance.

There are some methods to deal with data cleaning, but they are generally inefficient in cleaning the data because they suffer from variety of errors. In this paper we present an enhanced technique to clean data in the data warehouse by using a new algorithm that detects and corrects most of the error types and expected problems, such as lexical errors, domain format errors, irregularities, integrity constraint violation, and duplicates.",306-311,10.1109/DeSE.2011.32,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a01a325c6f0e63146e7161d55f9b8e4a43df760e,26,2011-12-06

Due to the major support of data warehouse in the daily transaction of an enterprise, the requirements for the design and the implementation of DW are dynamic and subjective. This dynamic nature of the data warehouse may reflect the evolution in the data warehouse. Data warehouse evolution may be focused on three approaches namely schema evolution, schema versioning and view maintenance. Evolution of the data warehouse may often change their data and structure (schema changes). These schema changes may be consider according to the change in structure, software and users"" requirement. Schema evolution in data warehouse consists of various level namely structural level, conceptual level and behavioural level. This paper mainly focuses on schema evolution and proposes the operators to handle the creation and evolution of aggregated fact table.

This data is extracted from operational databases; transformed into a coherent whole using a multidimensional model that includes measures, dimensions, and hierarchies; and loaded into a data warehouse during the extraction-transformation-loading (ETL) process. Malinowski and Zimnyi explain in detail conventional data warehouse design, covering in particular complex hierarchy modeling. Additionally, they address two innovative domains recently introduced to extend the capabilities of data warehouse systems, namely the management of spatial and temporal information. Their presentation covers different phases of the design process, such as requirements specification, conceptual, logical, and physical design. They include three different approaches for requirements specification depending on whether users, operational data sources, or both are the driving force in the requirements gathering process, and they show how each approach leads to the creation of a conceptual multidimensional model. Throughout the book the concepts are illustrated using many real-world examples and completed by sample implementations for Microsoft's Analysis Services 2005 and Oracle 10g with the OLAP and the Spatial extensions. For researchers this book serves as an introduction to the state of the art on data warehouse design, with many references to more detailed sources. Providing a clear and a concise presentation of the major concepts and results of data warehouse design, it can also be used as the basis of a graduate or advanced undergraduate course. The book may help experienced data warehouse designers to enlarge their analysis possibilities by incorporating spatial and temporal information. Finally, experts in spatial databases or in geographical information systems could benefit from the data warehouse vision for building innovative spatial analytical applications.",7-102,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/473a4d94774b4f46219348d9b3c14dc6fd7c2f21,235,2010-11-23

This paper proposes a novel digital twin-driven joint optimisation approach for warehousing in large-scale automated high-rise warehouse product-service system. A Digital Twin System is developed to aggregate real-time data from physical warehouse product-service system and then to map it to the cyber model. A joint optimisation model on how to timely optimise stacked packing and storage assignment of warehouse product-service system is integrated to the Digital Twin System. Through perceiving online data from the physical warehouse product-service system, periodical optimal decisions can be obtained via the joint optimisation model and then fed back to the semi-physical simulation engine in the Digital Twin System for verifying the implementation result. A demonstrative prototype is developed and verified with a case study of a tobacco warehouse product-service system. The proposed approach can maximise the utilisation and efficiency of the large-scale automated high-rise warehouse product-service system.",783 - 800,10.1080/0951192X.2019.1667032,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a0dbd60f1f3f76f16b73cd14dcfb9a33e298a2c,104,2019-09-29
f431475390a0a19b2fde1eb6e6b360c438b44968,VHA Corporate Data Warehouse height and weight data: opportunities and challenges for health services research.,"Within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), anthropometric measurements entered into the electronic medical record are stored in local information systems, the national Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), and in some regional data warehouses. This article describes efforts to examine the quality of weight and height data within the CDW and to compare CDW data with data from warehouses maintained by several of VHA's regional groupings of healthcare facilities (Veterans Integrated Service Networks [VISNs]). We found significantly fewer recorded heights than weights in both the CDW and VISN data sources. In spite of occasional anomalies, the concordance in the number and value of records in the CDW and the VISN warehouses was generally 97% to 99% or greater. Implausible variation in same-day and same-year heights and weights was noted, suggesting measurement or data-entry errors. Our work suggests that the CDW, over time and through validation, has become a generally reliable source of anthropometric data. Researchers should assess the reliability of data contained within any source and apply strategies to minimize the impact of data errors appropriate to their study population.","

If data is of inadequate quality, then the knowledge workers who query the data warehouse and the decision makers who receive the information cannot trust the results. In order to obtain clean and reliable data, it is imperative to focus on data quality. While many data warehouse projects do take data quality into consideration, it is often given a delayed afterthought. Even QA after ETL is not good enough the Quality process needs to be incorporated in the ETL process itself. Data quality has to be maintained for individual records or even small bits of information to ensure accuracy of complete database. Data quality is an increasingly serious issue for organizations large and small. It is central to all data integration initiatives. Before data can be used effectively in a data warehouse, or in customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning or business analytics applications, it needs to be analyzed and cleansed. To ensure high quality data is sustained, organizations need to apply ongoing data cleansing processes and procedures, and to monitor and track data quality levels over time. Otherwise poor data quality will lead to increased costs, breakdowns in the supply chain and inferior customer relationship management. Defective data also hampers business decision making and efforts to meet regulatory compliance responsibilities. The key to successfully addressing data quality is to get business professionals centrally involved in the process. We have analyzed possible set of causes of data quality issues from exhaustive survey and discussions with data warehouse groups working in distinguishes organizations in India and abroad. We expect this paper will help modelers, designers of warehouse to analyze and implement quality warehouse and business intelligence applications.",100-198,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff1934a103c32b8214e346047459f50039f78017,36,

c5ee3dde6eca0eafa53919b423dd94abae9e6573,Data ethics,"CUSP aims to utilize Big Data to help study and understand urban environments. As a part of this effort, we are planning to build an inclusive data warehouse at CUSP. Our vision for this data warehouse is to hold large quantities of data from multiple sources, including personal (most likely anonymized) data about individuals. But, obtaining, housing, and protecting these data come with many challenges and questions. We hope to answer some of these questions in this working session and converge on a set of principles that will guide our data practices moving forward. Personal data is a new asset class touching all aspects of society. It is potentially as valuable a resource in the 21st century as heavily traded physical goods like oil have been in the past hundred years. However, throughout history, economic value creation has been linked to the ability to move and trade physical goods. Similarly, "" data needs to move to create value. Data sitting alone on a server is like money hidden under a mattress. It is safe and secure, but largely stagnant and underutilized. "" But, personal data lacks the trading rules and policy frameworks that exist for widely traded physical assets. As a result, there is little trust among the key stakeholders,-individuals, governments and the private sector,-which could undermine its long-term potential. In response to surveys, individuals generally say that they want enhanced control over their personal data, increased transparency on how it is used, and some kind of fair value in return. However, their actions are often quite different. While many say they care deeply about privacy, they share information quite widely online. They often sign up for services not knowing how their data will be protected or whether it will be shared. They rarely read the privacy policies of the organizations providing these services, which are usually written in hard-to-comprehend legal language. Companies, on the other hand, view the data they have captured or created about individuals as theirs. Data is an asset on which they have invested significant resources. They want to leverage the data to create business value, better understand the behavior of their customers and help themselves become more productive. They struggle with how to best protect all the data they now have access to, as well as trying to figure out the different regulations pertaining to its use. Governments are trying to leverage all this data …",93-172,10.4324/9781003201182-27,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c5ee3dde6eca0eafa53919b423dd94abae9e6573,212,2021-10-04

The aim of this tool is to address to the three main issues affecting such decision: the cost of the information sharing, the scarce visibility of the client’s data and the uncertainty of quantifying the return from investing into a WMS feature.Design/methodology/approachThe tool behaves as a digital twin of a WMS. In addition, it incorporates a set of WMS’s features based both on heuristics and optimization techniques and uses simulation to perform what-if multi-scenario analyses of alternative management scenarios. In order to validate the effectiveness of the tool, its application to a real-world 3PL warehouse operating in the sector of biomedical products is illustrated.FindingsThe results of a simulation campaign along an observation horizon of ten months demonstrate how the tool supports the comparison of alternative scenarios with theas-is, thereby suggesting the most suitable WMS customization to adopt.Practical implicationsThe tool supports 3PL managers in enhancing the efficiency of the operations and the fulfilling of the required service level, which is increasingly challenging given the large inventory mix and the variable clients portfolio that 3PLs have to manage. Particularly, the choice of the WMS customization that better perform with each business can be problematic, given the scarce information visibility of the provider on the client’s processes.Originality/valueTo the author’s knowledge, this paper is among the first to address a still uncovered gap of the warehousing literature by illustrating a DST that exploits optimization and simulation techniques to quantify the impacts of the information availability on the warehousing operations performance.

As the real-time enterprise evolves, synchronism between transactional data and data warehouses is redefined. To cope with real-time requirements, the data warehouses must be able to enable continuous data integration, in order to deal with the most recent business data. Traditional data warehouses are unable to support any dynamics in structure and content while they are available for OLAP. Their data is periodically updated because they are unprepared for continuous data integration. For real-time enterprises with needs in decision support while the transactions are occurring, (near) real-time data warehousing seem very promising. In this paper we present a survey on testing today's most used loading techniques and analyze which are the best data loading methods, presenting a methodology for efficiently supporting continuous data integration for data warehouses. To accomplish this, we use techniques such as table structure replication with minimum content and query predicate restrictions for selecting data, to enable loading data in the data warehouse continuously, with minimum impact in query execution time.

c0985494b16273b1c18847675340001fbcd9f7e7,Data Warehouse Performance,"A data warehouse is a large electronic repository of information that is generated and updated in a structured manner by an enterprise over time to aid business intelligence and to support decision making. Data stored in a data warehouse is non-volatile and time variant and is organized by subjects in a manner to support decision making (Inmon et al., 2001). Data warehousing has been increasingly adopted by enterprises as the backbone technology for business intelligence reporting and query performance has become the key to the successful implementation of data warehouses. According to a survey of 358 businesses on reporting and end-user query tools, conducted by Appfluent Technology, data warehouse performance significantly affects the Return on Investment (ROI) on Business Intelligence (BI) systems and directly impacts the bottom line of the systems (Appfluent Technology, 2002). Even though in some circumstances it is very difficult to measure the benefits of BI projects in terms of ROI or dollar figures, management teams are still eager to have a “single version of the truth,” better information for strategic and tactical decision making, and more efficient business processes by using BI solutions (Eckerson, 2003). Dramatic increases in data volumes over time and the mixed quality of data can adversely affect the performance of a data warehouse. Some data may become outdated over time and can be mixed with data that are still valid for decision making. In addition, data are often collected to meet potential requirements, but may never be used. Data warehouses also contain external data (e.g. demographic, psychographic, etc.) to support a variety of predictive data mining activities. All these factors contribute to the massive growth of data volume. As a result, even a simple query may become burdensome to process and cause overflowing system indices (Inmon et al., 1998). Thus, exploring the techniques of performance tuning becomes an important subject in data warehouse management.",580-585,10.4018/978-1-59140-557-3.CH061,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c0985494b16273b1c18847675340001fbcd9f7e7,23,

In such a system, the data placement structure is a critical factor that can affect the warehouse performance in a fundamental way. Based on our observations and analysis of Facebook production systems, we have characterized four requirements for the data placement structure: (1) fast data loading, (2) fast query processing, (3) highly efficient storage space utilization, and (4) strong adaptivity to highly dynamic workload patterns. We have examined three commonly accepted data placement structures in conventional databases, namely row-stores, column-stores, and hybrid-stores in the context of large data analysis using MapReduce. We show that they are not very suitable for big data processing in distributed systems. In this paper, we present a big data placement structure called RCFile (Record Columnar File) and its implementation in the Hadoop system. With intensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of RCFile in satisfying the four requirements. RCFile has been chosen in Facebook data warehouse system as the default option. It has also been adopted by Hive and Pig, the two most widely used data analysis systems developed in Facebook and Yahoo!",1199-1208,10.1109/ICDE.2011.5767933,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d34c2d4ab26d5b9f901dd9c57f9acf0dad079c6,288,2011-04-11

However, XML-native database systems currently suffer from limited performances in terms of manageable data volume and response time for complex analytical queries. Fragmenting and distributing XML data warehouses (e.g., on data grids) allow to address both these issues. In this paper, we work on XML warehouse fragmentation. In relational data warehouses, several studies recommend the use of derived horizontal fragmentation. Hence, we propose to adapt it to the XML context. We particularly focus on the initial horizontal fragmentation of dimensions' XML documents and exploit two alternative algorithms. We experimentally validate our proposal and compare these alternatives with respect to a unified XML warehouse model we advocate for.",36-198,10.1145/1529282.1529630,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5b6ba7a04d1245d7233af9874206f8b9e8fe1c44,32,2009-03-08

4c01ae3022cfeeb4ab0f679d708ecd67fe156c74,Building a Data Warehouse: With Examples in SQL Server,"Building a Data Warehouse: With Examples in SQL Server describes how to build a data warehouse completely from scratch and shows practical examples on how to do it. Author Vincent Rainardi also describes some practical issues he has experienced that developers are likely to encounter in their first data warehousing project, along with solutions and advice. The RDBMS used in the examples is SQL Server; the version will not be an issue as long as the user has SQL Server 2005 or later. 
 
The book is organized as follows. In the beginning of this book (Chapters 1 through 6), you learn how to build a data warehouse, for example, defining the architecture, understanding the methodology, gathering the requirements, designing the data models, and creating the databases. Then in Chapters 7 through 10, you learn how to populate the data warehouse, for example, extracting from source systems, loading the data stores, maintaining data quality, and utilizing the metadata. After you populate the data warehouse, in Chapters 11 through 15, you explore how to present data to users using reports and multidimensional databases and how to use the data in the data warehouse for business intelligence, customer relationship management, and other purposes. Chapters 16 and 17 wrap up the book: After you have built your data warehouse, before it can be released to production, you need to test it thoroughly. After your application is in production, you need to understand how to administer data warehouse operation.

Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.",802-810,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f9c990b1b5724e50e5632b94fdb7484ece8a6ce7,6405,2015-06-13

AI systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that these decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. More recently some work has been developed in traditional machine learning and deep learning that address such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming more aware of the biases that these applications can contain and are attempting to address them. In this survey, we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and ways they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems.

554894f70b28dba58b396c2d84080ac01051261b,Gaussian Processes For Machine Learning,"Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other ""kernel machines"" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.","

807c1f19047f96083e13614f7ce20f2ac98c239a,C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning,"From the Publisher: 
Classifier systems play a major role in machine learning and knowledge-based systems, and Ross Quinlan's work on ID3 and C4.5 is widely acknowledged to have made some of the most significant contributions to their development. This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette for a Sun workstation. 
 
C4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies.

Unfortunately, this tuning is often a ""black art"" requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expertlevel performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.",2960-2968,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2e2089ae76fe914706e6fa90081a79c8fe01611e,6691,2012-06-13

Testing with Concept Activation Vectors, TCAV, (Kim et al. 2017) is an approach to interpreting DNNs in a human-friendly way and has recently received significant attention in the machine learning community. The TCAV algorithm achieves a degree of global interpretability for DNNs through human-defined concepts as explanations. This project introduces Robust TCAV, which builds on TCAV and experimentally determines best practices for this method. The objectives for Robust TCAV are 1) Making TCAV more consistent by reducing variance in the TCAV score distribution and 2) Increasing CAV and TCAV score resistance to perturbations. A difference of means method for CAV generation was determined to be the best practice to achieve both objectives. Many areas of the TCAV process are explored including CAV visualization in low dimensions, negative class selection, and activation perturbation in the direction of a CAV. Finally, a thresholding technique is considered to remove noise in TCAV scores. This project is a step in the direction of making TCAV, an already impactful algorithm in interpretability, more reliable and useful for practitioners.",23-128,10.1201/9780367816377-16,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0c34618ffd1154f35863e2ce7250ac6b6f2c424,2088,2019-11-07

These explanations are often used to qualitatively assess other criteria such as safety or non-discrimination.

We focus on the basic membership inference attack: given a data record and black-box access to a model, determine if the record was in the model's training dataset. To perform membership inference against a target model, we make adversarial use of machine learning and train our own inference model to recognize differences in the target model's predictions on the inputs that it trained on versus the inputs that it did not train on. We empirically evaluate our inference techniques on classification models trained by commercial ""machine learning as a service"" providers such as Google and Amazon. Using realistic datasets and classification tasks, including a hospital discharge dataset whose membership is sensitive from the privacy perspective, we show that these models can be vulnerable to membership inference attacks. We then investigate the factors that influence this leakage and evaluate mitigation strategies.",3-18,10.1109/SP.2017.41,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0dcc9aa31dc9b31b836bcac1b140c8c94a2982d,3012,2016-10-18

53b047e503f4c24602f376a774d653f7ed56c024,Practical Black-Box Attacks against Machine Learning,"Machine learning (ML) models, e.g., deep neural networks (DNNs), are vulnerable to adversarial examples: malicious inputs modified to yield erroneous model outputs, while appearing unmodified to human observers. Potential attacks include having malicious content like malware identified as legitimate or controlling vehicle behavior. Yet, all existing adversarial example attacks require knowledge of either the model internals or its training data. We introduce the first practical demonstration of an attacker controlling a remotely hosted DNN with no such knowledge. Indeed, the only capability of our black-box adversary is to observe labels given by the DNN to chosen inputs. Our attack strategy consists in training a local model to substitute for the target DNN, using inputs synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by the target DNN. We use the local substitute to craft adversarial examples, and find that they are misclassified by the targeted DNN. To perform a real-world and properly-blinded evaluation, we attack a DNN hosted by MetaMind, an online deep learning API. We find that their DNN misclassifies 84.24% of the adversarial examples crafted with our substitute. We demonstrate the general applicability of our strategy to many ML techniques by conducting the same attack against models hosted by Amazon and Google, using logistic regression substitutes. They yield adversarial examples misclassified by Amazon and Google at rates of 96.19% and 88.94%. We also find that this black-box attack strategy is capable of evading defense strategies previously found to make adversarial example crafting harder.",31-108,10.1145/3052973.3053009,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/53b047e503f4c24602f376a774d653f7ed56c024,3154,2016-02-08

Adversarial training is the process of explicitly training a model on adversarial examples, in order to make it more robust to attack or to reduce its test error on clean inputs. So far, adversarial training has primarily been applied to small problems. In this research, we apply adversarial training to ImageNet. Our contributions include: (1) recommendations for how to succesfully scale adversarial training to large models and datasets, (2) the observation that adversarial training confers robustness to single-step attack methods, (3) the finding that multi-step attack methods are somewhat less transferable than single-step attack methods, so single-step attacks are the best for mounting black-box attacks, and (4) resolution of a ""label leaking"" effect that causes adversarially trained models to perform better on adversarial examples than on clean examples, because the adversarial example construction process uses the true label and the model can learn to exploit regularities in the construction process.",27-195,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e2a85a6766b982ff7c8980e57ca6342d22493827,2678,2016-11-03

fa72afa9b2cbc8f0d7b05d52548906610ffbb9c5,Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate,"Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.",3-121,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa72afa9b2cbc8f0d7b05d52548906610ffbb9c5,24641,2014-09-01

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder‐Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.",1724-1734,10.3115/v1/D14-1179,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0b544dfe355a5070b60986319a3f51fb45d1348e,20200,2014-06-03

Through case studies on text classification and the training of deep neural networks, we discuss how optimization problems arise in machine learning and what makes them challenging. A major theme of our study is that large-scale machine learning represents a distinctive setting in which the stochastic gradient (SG) method has traditionally played a central role while conventional gradient-based nonlinear optimization techniques typically falter. Based on this viewpoint, we present a comprehensive theory of a straightforward, yet versatile SG algorithm, discuss its practical behavior, and highlight opportunities for designing algorithms with improved performance.

SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods—random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression—as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10–fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56% (coarse fragments) and 83% (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61%. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230%. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced.

In contrast, machine-learning models can approximate physics very quickly but at the cost of accuracy. Here we show that using machine learning inside traditional fluid simulations can improve both accuracy and speed, even on examples very different from the training data. Our approach opens the door to applying machine learning to large-scale physical modeling tasks like airplane design and climate prediction. Numerical simulation of fluids plays an essential role in modeling many physical phenomena, such as weather, climate, aerodynamics, and plasma physics. Fluids are well described by the Navier–Stokes equations, but solving these equations at scale remains daunting, limited by the computational cost of resolving the smallest spatiotemporal features. This leads to unfavorable trade-offs between accuracy and tractability. Here we use end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of turbulence and large-eddy simulation, our results are as accurate as baseline solvers with 8 to 10× finer resolution in each spatial dimension, resulting in 40- to 80-fold computational speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations and generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black-box machine-learning approaches.

One is that, in most industries, data exists in the form of isolated islands. The other is the strengthening of data privacy and security. We propose a possible solution to these challenges: secure federated learning. Beyond the federated-learning framework first proposed by Google in 2016, we introduce a comprehensive secure federated-learning framework, which includes horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning, and federated transfer learning. We provide definitions, architectures, and applications for the federated-learning framework, and provide a comprehensive survey of existing works on this subject. In addition, we propose building data networks among organizations based on federated mechanisms as an effective solution to allowing knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy.",1 - 19,10.1145/3298981,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/62ccd99a65bfc7c735ae1f33b75b107665de95df,1765,2019-01-28
f75b70c9d7078724b592ec3e21de705e7b6ff73f,Double/Debiased Machine Learning for Treatment and Structural Parameters,"We revisit the classic semiparametric problem of inference on a low dimensional parameter θ_0 in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters η_0. We depart from the classical setting by allowing for η_0 to be so high-dimensional that the traditional assumptions, such as Donsker properties, that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate η_0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods which are particularly well-suited to estimation in modern, very high-dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating η_0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of θ_0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of η_0 into estimating equations for θ_0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N^(-1/2) consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest θ_0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman-orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate θ_0, and (2) making use of cross-fitting which provides an efficient form of data-splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in a N^(-1/2)-neighborhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model, DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model, DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness, and DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.",13-163,10.1111/ectj.12097,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f75b70c9d7078724b592ec3e21de705e7b6ff73f,1612,2017-06-01

6bc43977fb11cceed0b9aa55b23c6dd29dd9a132,Correlation-based Feature Selection for Machine Learning,"A central problem in machine learning is identifying a representative set of features from which to construct a classification model for a particular task. This thesis addresses the problem of feature selection for machine learning through a correlation based approach. The central hypothesis is that good feature sets contain features that are highly correlated with the class, yet uncorrelated with each other. A feature evaluation formula, based on ideas from test theory, provides an operational definition of this hypothesis. CFS (Correlation based Feature Selection) is an algorithm that couples this evaluation formula with an appropriate correlation measure and a heuristic search strategy. CFS was evaluated by experiments on artificial and natural datasets. Three machine learning algorithms were used: C4.5 (a decision tree learner), IB1 (an instance based learner), and naive Bayes. Experiments on artificial datasets showed that CFS quickly identifies and screens irrelevant, redundant, and noisy features, and identifies relevant features as long as their relevance does not strongly depend on other features. On natural domains, CFS typically eliminated well over half the features. In most cases, classification accuracy using the reduced feature set equaled or bettered accuracy using the complete feature set. Feature selection degraded machine learning performance in cases where some features were eliminated which were highly predictive of very small areas of the instance space. Further experiments compared CFS with a wrapper—a well known approach to feature selection that employs the target learning algorithm to evaluate feature sets. In many cases CFS gave comparable results to the wrapper, and in general, outperformed the wrapper on small datasets. CFS executes many times faster than the wrapper, which allows it to scale to larger datasets. Two methods of extending CFS to handle feature interaction are presented and experimentally evaluated. The first considers pairs of features and the second incorporates iii feature weights calculated by the RELIEF algorithm. Experiments on artificial domains showed that both methods were able to identify interacting features. On natural domains, the pairwise method gave more reliable results than using weights provided by RELIEF.",92-196,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6bc43977fb11cceed0b9aa55b23c6dd29dd9a132,3812,

Explaining, in a human-understandable way, the relationship between the input and output of machine learning models is essential to the development of trustworthy machine-learning-based systems. A burgeoning body of research seeks to define the goals and methods of explainability in machine learning. In this paper, we seek to review and categorize research on counterfactual explanations, a specific class of explanation that provides a link between what could have happened had input to a model been changed in a particular way. Modern approaches to counterfactual explainability in machine learning draw connections to the established legal doctrine in many countries, making them appealing to fielded systems in high-impact areas such as finance and healthcare. Thus, we design a rubric with desirable properties of counterfactual explanation algorithms and comprehensively evaluate all currently-proposed algorithms against that rubric. Our rubric provides easy comparison and comprehension of the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches and serves as an introduction to major research themes in this field. We also identify gaps and discuss promising research directions in the space of counterfactual explainability.",48-185,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6068d39e92aef1bb0e1291e9931894c35692a85e,337,2020-10-20

b9518627db25f05930e931f56497602363a75491,"Definitions, methods, and applications in interpretable machine learning","Significance The recent surge in interpretability research has led to confusion on numerous fronts. In particular, it is unclear what it means to be interpretable and how to select, evaluate, or even discuss methods for producing interpretations of machine-learning models. We aim to clarify these concerns by defining interpretable machine learning and constructing a unifying framework for existing methods which highlights the underappreciated role played by human audiences. Within this framework, methods are organized into 2 classes: model based and post hoc. To provide guidance in selecting and evaluating interpretation methods, we introduce 3 desiderata: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy. Using our framework, we review existing work, grounded in real-world studies which exemplify our desiderata, and suggest directions for future work. Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.",22071 - 22080,10.1073/pnas.1900654116,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b9518627db25f05930e931f56497602363a75491,1043,2019-01-14
739769f4862753fc80057194456d758d2a148ee3,Extreme Learning Machine for Regression and Multiclass Classification,"Due to the simplicity of their implementations, least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and proximal support vector machine (PSVM) have been widely used in binary classification applications. The conventional LS-SVM and PSVM cannot be used in regression and multiclass classification applications directly, although variants of LS-SVM and PSVM have been proposed to handle such cases. This paper shows that both LS-SVM and PSVM can be simplified further and a unified learning framework of LS-SVM, PSVM, and other regularization algorithms referred to extreme learning machine (ELM) can be built. ELM works for the “generalized” single-hidden-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs), but the hidden layer (or called feature mapping) in ELM need not be tuned. Such SLFNs include but are not limited to SVM, polynomial network, and the conventional feedforward neural networks. This paper shows the following: 1) ELM provides a unified learning platform with a widespread type of feature mappings and can be applied in regression and multiclass classification applications directly; 2) from the optimization method point of view, ELM has milder optimization constraints compared to LS-SVM and PSVM; 3) in theory, compared to ELM, LS-SVM and PSVM achieve suboptimal solutions and require higher computational complexity; and 4) in theory, ELM can approximate any target continuous function and classify any disjoint regions. As verified by the simulation results, ELM tends to have better scalability and achieve similar (for regression and binary class cases) or much better (for multiclass cases) generalization performance at much faster learning speed (up to thousands times) than traditional SVM and LS-SVM.",513-529,10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2168604,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/739769f4862753fc80057194456d758d2a148ee3,4820,2012-04-01

It is traditionally believed that fitting models to the training data exactly is to be avoided as it leads to poor performance on unseen data. However, powerful modern classifiers frequently have near-perfect fit in training, a disconnect that spurred recent intensive research and controversy on whether theory provides practical insights. In this work, we show how classical theory and modern practice can be reconciled within a single unified performance curve and propose a mechanism underlying its emergence. We believe this previously unknown pattern connecting the structure and performance of learning architectures will help shape design and understanding of learning algorithms. Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias–variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias–variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This “double-descent” curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias–variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.",15849 - 15854,10.1073/pnas.1903070116,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f86f1748d1b6d22870f4347fd5d65314ba800583,1251,2018-12-28

These systems’s adoption has been expanding, accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society, meaning that algorithmically informed decisions have greater potential for significant social impact. However, most of these accurate decision support systems remain complex black boxes, meaning their internal logic and inner workings are hidden to the user and even experts cannot fully understand the rationale behind their predictions. Moreover, new regulations and highly regulated domains have made the audit and verifiability of decisions mandatory, increasing the demand for the ability to question, understand, and trust machine learning systems, for which interpretability is indispensable. The research community has recognized this interpretability problem and focused on developing both interpretable models and explanation methods over the past few years. However, the emergence of these methods shows there is no consensus on how to assess the explanation quality. Which are the most suitable metrics to assess the quality of an explanation?

This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components - models may be ""entangled"" in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior.

b7a717233ec3ff37385ab1b06816d0ca375f5bb3,Data Shapley: Equitable Valuation of Data for Machine Learning,"As data becomes the fuel driving technological and economic growth, a fundamental challenge is how to quantify the value of data in algorithmic predictions and decisions. For example, in healthcare and consumer markets, it has been suggested that individuals should be compensated for the data that they generate, but it is not clear what is an equitable valuation for individual data. In this work, we develop a principled framework to address data valuation in the context of supervised machine learning. Given a learning algorithm trained on $n$ data points to produce a predictor, we propose data Shapley as a metric to quantify the value of each training datum to the predictor performance. Data Shapley value uniquely satisfies several natural properties of equitable data valuation. We develop Monte Carlo and gradient-based methods to efficiently estimate data Shapley values in practical settings where complex learning algorithms, including neural networks, are trained on large datasets. In addition to being equitable, extensive experiments across biomedical, image and synthetic data demonstrate that data Shapley has several other benefits: 1) it is more powerful than the popular leave-one-out or leverage score in providing insight on what data is more valuable for a given learning task; 2) low Shapley value data effectively capture outliers and corruptions; 3) high Shapley value data inform what type of new data to acquire to improve the predictor.",27-113,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b7a717233ec3ff37385ab1b06816d0ca375f5bb3,495,2019-04-05

We identify underspecification as a key reason for these failures. An ML pipeline is underspecified when it can return many predictors with equivalently strong held-out performance in the training domain. Underspecification is common in modern ML pipelines, such as those based on deep learning. Predictors returned by underspecified pipelines are often treated as equivalent based on their training domain performance, but we show here that such predictors can behave very differently in deployment domains. This ambiguity can lead to instability and poor model behavior in practice, and is a distinct failure mode from previously identified issues arising from structural mismatch between training and deployment domains. We show that this problem appears in a wide variety of practical ML pipelines, using examples from computer vision, medical imaging, natural language processing, clinical risk prediction based on electronic health records, and medical genomics. Our results show the need to explicitly account for underspecification in modeling pipelines that are intended for real-world deployment in any domain.",226:1-226:61,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/71a85e735a3686bef8cce3725ae5ba82e2cabb1b,536,2020-11-06

The first part of the circuit implements a quantum feature map that encodes classical inputs into quantum states, embedding the data in a high-dimensional Hilbert space; the second part of the circuit executes a quantum measurement interpreted as the output of the model. Usually, the measurement is trained to distinguish quantum-embedded data. We propose to instead train the first part of the circuit---the embedding---with the objective of maximally separating data classes in Hilbert space, a strategy we call quantum metric learning. As a result, the measurement minimizing a linear classification loss is already known and depends on the metric used: for embeddings separating data using the l1 or trace distance, this is the Helstrom measurement, while for the l2 or Hilbert-Schmidt distance, it is a simple overlap measurement.

Object detection has benefited enormously from large-scale datasets, especially in the context of deep learning.

To address this, we introduce Cityscapes, a benchmark suite and large-scale dataset to train and test approaches for pixel-level and instance-level semantic labeling. Cityscapes is comprised of a large, diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities. 5000 of these images have high quality pixel-level annotations, 20 000 additional images have coarse annotations to enable methods that leverage large volumes of weakly-labeled data.

92893716be3b7fed89e989dfd4ab4af5e5d8f214,Regularizing Deep Networks With Semantic Data Augmentation,"Data augmentation is widely known as a simple yet surprisingly effective technique for regularizing deep networks. Conventional data augmentation schemes, e.g., flipping, translation or rotation, are low-level, data-independent and class-agnostic operations, leading to limited diversity for augmented samples. To this end, we propose a novel semantic data augmentation algorithm to complement traditional approaches. The proposed method is inspired by the intriguing property that deep networks are effective in learning linearized features, i.e., certain directions in the deep feature space correspond to meaningful semantic transformations, e.g., changing the background or view angle of an object. Based on this observation, translating training samples along many such directions in the feature space can effectively augment the dataset for more diversity. To implement this idea, we first introduce a sampling based method to obtain semantically meaningful directions efficiently. Then, an upper bound of the expected cross-entropy (CE) loss on the augmented training set is derived by assuming the number of augmented samples goes to infinity, yielding a highly efficient algorithm. In fact, we show that the proposed implicit semantic data augmentation (ISDA) algorithm amounts to minimizing a novel robust CE loss, which adds minimal extra computational cost to a normal training procedure. In addition to supervised learning, ISDA can be applied to semi-supervised learning tasks under the consistency regularization framework, where ISDA amounts to minimizing the upper bound of the expected KL-divergence between the augmented features and the original features. Although being simple, ISDA consistently improves the generalization performance of popular deep models (e.g., ResNets and DenseNets) on a variety of datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, ImageNet, and Cityscapes.

10ffcae001fa724f9fd49fe0726c32166df9209b,Semantic data mining in the information age: A systematic review,"Data mining is the discovery of meaningful information or unrevealed patterns in data. Traditional data‐mining approaches, using statistical calculations, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and database technology, cannot interpret data on a conceptual or semantic level and fail to reveal the meanings within the data. This results in a user not being analyzed and determines its signification and implications. Several semantic data‐mining approaches have been proposed in the past decade that overcome these limitations by using a domain ontology as background knowledge to enable and enhance data‐mining performance. The main contributions of this literature survey include organizing the surveyed articles in a new way that provides ease of understanding for interested researchers, and the provision of a critical analysis and summary of the surveyed articles, identifying the contribution of these papers to the field, and the limitations of the analysis methods and approaches discussed in this corpus, with the intention of informing researchers in this growing field in their innovative approaches to new research. Finally, we identify the future trends and challenges in this study track that will be of concern to future researchers, such as dynamic knowledge‐based methods or big‐data tool collaboration. This survey article provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on domain ontologies as used in the various semantic data‐mining tasks, such as preprocessing, modeling, and postprocessing.

11babff42b5bf9841ebb87781bfc21f74acb3d28,Implicit Semantic Data Augmentation for Deep Networks,"In this paper, we propose a novel implicit semantic data augmentation (ISDA) approach to complement traditional augmentation techniques like flipping, translation or rotation. Our work is motivated by the intriguing property that deep networks are surprisingly good at linearizing features, such that certain directions in the deep feature space correspond to meaningful semantic transformations, e.g., adding sunglasses or changing backgrounds. As a consequence, translating training samples along many semantic directions in the feature space can effectively augment the dataset to improve generalization. To implement this idea effectively and efficiently, we first perform an online estimate of the covariance matrix of deep features for each class, which captures the intra-class semantic variations. Then random vectors are drawn from a zero-mean normal distribution with the estimated covariance to augment the training data in that class. Importantly, instead of augmenting the samples explicitly, we can directly minimize an upper bound of the expected cross-entropy (CE) loss on the augmented training set, leading to a highly efficient algorithm. In fact, we show that the proposed ISDA amounts to minimizing a novel robust CE loss, which adds negligible extra computational cost to a normal training procedure. Although being simple, ISDA consistently improves the generalization performance of popular deep models (ResNets and DenseNets) on a variety of datasets, e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.

Existing data preparation and analysis systems rely on dictionary lookups and regular expression matching to detect semantic types. However, these matching-based approaches often are not robust to dirty data and only detect a limited number of types. We introduce Sherlock, a multi-input deep neural network for detecting semantic types. We train Sherlock on $686,765$ data columns retrieved from the VizNet corpus by matching $78$ semantic types from DBpedia to column headers. We characterize each matched column with $1,588$ features describing the statistical properties, character distributions, word embeddings, and paragraph vectors of column values. Sherlock achieves a support-weighted F$_1$ score of $0.89$, exceeding that of machine learning baselines, dictionary and regular expression benchmarks, and the consensus of crowdsourced annotations.",100-193,10.1145/3292500.3330993,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b03e4702c8427b2458234ff8f37358c68177ccbb,131,2019-05-25

These devices provide real‐time semantic data that can be used to recognize daily life physical activities for personalized smart health assessment. Existing studies focus on the recognition of simple physical activities but they lacked in providing accurate recognition of physical activities having complex interclass variations. Therefore, this research focuses on the accurate recognition of physical activities having complex interclass variations. We propose a two‐layered approach called PARCIVthat first clusters similar activities based on semantic data and then recognize them using a machine learning classifier. Our two‐layered approach first bounds the highly indistinguishable activities in clusters to avoid misclassification with other distinguishable activities and thereafter recognize them on a fine‐grained level within each cluster. To evaluate our approach, we make an android application that collects labeled data by using smartphone sensors from 10 participants, while performing activities. PARCIV recognizes distinguishable as well as indistinguishable activities with high accuracy of 99% on the self‐collected dataset. Furthermore, PARCIV achieve 95% accuracy on the publicly available dataset used by state‐of‐the‐art studies. PARCIVoutperforms various state‐of‐the‐art studies by 8%‐17% for simple activities as well as complex activities.",532 - 549,10.1002/spe.2846,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c96408fc1e34effc99ec4cc35b5561ef0c1fed3,31,2020-05-27

While these documents are useful in helping an end-user properly interpret the meaning of a column in a data set, existing data dictionaries typically are not machine-readable and do not follow a common specification standard. We introduce the Semantic Data Dictionary, a specification that formalizes the assignment of a semantic representation of data, enabling standardization and harmonization across diverse data sets. In this paper, we present our Semantic Data Dictionary work in the context of our work with biomedical data; however, the approach can and has been used in a wide range of domains. The rendition of data in this form helps promote improved discovery, interoperability, reuse, traceability, and reproducibility. We present the associated research and describe how the Semantic Data Dictionary can help address existing limitations in the related literature. We discuss our approach, present an example by annotating portions of the publicly available National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data set, present modeling challenges, and describe the use of this approach in sponsored research, including our work on a large National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded exposure and health data portal and in the RPI-IBM collaborative Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning, and Semantics project.

To achieve this, we implemented SemEHR - a semantic search and analytics, open source tool for EHRs. Methods SemEHR implements a generic information extraction (IE) and retrieval infrastructure by identifying contextualised mentions of a wide range of biomedical concepts within EHRs. Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotations are further assembled at patient level and extended with EHR-specific knowledge to generate a timeline for each patient. The semantic data is serviced via ontology-based search and analytics interfaces. Results SemEHR has been deployed to a number of UK hospitals including the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS), an anonymised replica of the EHR of the UK South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust, one of Europes largest providers of mental health services. In two CRIS-based studies, SemEHR achieved 93% (Hepatitis C case) and 99% (HIV case) F-Measure results in identifying true positive patients. At King’s College Hospital in London, as part of the CogStack programme (github.com/cogstack), SemEHR is being used to recruit patients into the UK Dept of Health 100k Genome Project (genomicsengland.co.uk). The validation study suggests that the tool can validate previously recruited cases and is very fast in searching phenotypes - time for recruitment criteria checking reduced from days to minutes. Validated on an open intensive care EHR data - MIMICIII, the vital signs extracted by SemEHR can achieve around 97% accuracy. Conclusion Results from the multiple case studies demonstrate SemEHR’s efficiency - weeks or months of work can be done within hours or minutes in some cases. SemEHR provides a more comprehensive view of a patient, bringing in more and unexpected insight compared to study-oriented bespoke information extraction systems.

Industrial data analysis plays important roles in condition monitoring, performance optimization, flexibility, and transparency of the manufacturing system. However, the currently existing architectures are mainly for offline data analysis, not suitable for real-time data processing. In this paper, we first define the smart factory as a cloud-assisted and self-organized manufacturing system in which physical entities such as machines, conveyors, and products organize production through intelligent negotiation and the cloud supervises this self-organized process for fault detection and troubleshooting based on data analysis. Then, we propose a scheme to integrate knowledge reasoning and semantic data where the reasoning engine processes the ontology model with real time semantic data coming from the production process. Based on these ideas, we build a benchmarking system for smart candy packing application that supports direct consumer customization and flexible hybrid production, and the data are collected and processed in real time for fault diagnosis and statistical analysis.",13-176,10.3390/s18020471,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e7af4716dd7c0b6601c0929d54a6404af6df5a33,38,2018-02-01

The data warehouse serves as the appropriate technology for effective and efficient data management, which is paramount to the success of precision dairy farming. This paper presents a joint effort between industry and academia on the experimental development of an active semantic data warehouse to support business intelligence and business analytics in precision dairy farming. The research follows an action research approach, deriving lessons for theory and practice from a set of actions taken in the course of the project. Among these actions are the development of a loading stage to facilitate data integration, the definition of an analysis view as well as the introduction of semantic OLAP patterns to facilitate analysis, and analysis rules to automate periodic analyses. The large volumes of generated sensor data in precision dairy farming required careful decision-making concerning the appropriate level of detail of the data stored in the data warehouse. Semantic technologies played a key role in rendering analysis accessible to end users.",122 - 141,10.1080/10919392.2018.1444344,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0856f7c043b812e684593ed989151e2300e789de,29,2018-03-26
d5ab4aab4d30bc9f76151a50ca509030e5c1bcdc,AnchorViz: Facilitating Classifier Error Discovery through Interactive Semantic Data Exploration,"When building a classifier in interactive machine learning, human knowledge about the target class can be a powerful reference to make the classifier robust to unseen items. The main challenge lies in finding unlabeled items that can either help discover or refine concepts for which the current classifier has no corresponding features (i.e., it has feature blindness). Yet it is unrealistic to ask humans to come up with an exhaustive list of items, especially for rare concepts that are hard to recall. This paper presents AnchorViz, an interactive visualization that facilitates error discovery through semantic data exploration. By creating example-based anchors, users create a topology to spread data based on their similarity to the anchors and examine the inconsistencies between data points that are semantically related. The results from our user study show that AnchorViz helps users discover more prediction errors than stratified random and uncertainty sampling methods.",78-132,10.1145/3172944.3172950,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d5ab4aab4d30bc9f76151a50ca509030e5c1bcdc,34,2018-03-05

A new generation of data-analytics and data-preparation systems are starting to automatically recognize rich semantic types such as date-time, email address, etc., for such metadata can bring an array of benefits including better table understanding, improved search relevance, precise data validation, and semantic data transformation. However, existing approaches only detect a limited number of types using regular-expression-like patterns, which are often inaccurate, and cannot handle rich semantic types such as credit card and ISBN numbers that encode semantic validations (e.g., checksum). We developed AUTOTYPE from open-source repositories like GitHub. Users only need to provide a set of positive examples for a target data type and a search keyword, our system will automatically identify relevant code, and synthesize type-detection functions using execution traces. We compiled a benchmark with 112 semantic types, out of which the proposed system can synthesize code to detect 84 such types at a high precision. Applying the synthesized type-detection logic on web table columns have also resulted in a significant increase in data types discovered compared to alternative approaches.",85-187,10.1145/3183713.3196888,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30c2433a934ead817308aa05ae42728f6b743af3,28,2018-04-20

In the past, many research efforts have attested the benefits of incorporating domain knowledge in data mining. At the same time, the proliferation of knowledge engineering has enriched the family of domain knowledge, especially formal semantics and Semantic Web ontologies. Ontology is an explicit specification of conceptualization and a formal way to define the semantics of knowledge and data. The formal structure of ontology makes it a nature way to encode domain knowledge for the data mining use. In this survey paper, we introduce general concepts of semantic data mining.

For example, general domain knowledge bases such as DBpedia or Wikidata, or domain specific Web sources like the Oxford Art archive, allow for accessing knowledge about a wide variety of entities including people, organizations, or art paintings. However, these data sources publish data in different ways, and they may be equipped with different search capabilities, e.g., SPARQL endpoints or REST services, thus requiring data integration techniques that provide a unified view of the published data. We devise a semantic data integration approach named FuhSen that exploits keyword and structured search capabilities of Web data sources and generates on-demand knowledge graphs merging data collected from available Web sources. Resulting knowledge graphs model semantics or meaning of merged data in terms of entities that satisfy keyword queries, and relationships among those entities. FuhSen relies on both RDF to semantically describe the collected entities, and on semantic similarity measures to decide on relatedness among entities that should be merged. We empirically evaluate the results of FuhSen data integration techniques on data from the DBpedia knowledge base. The experimental results suggest that FuhSen data integration techniques accurately integrate similar entities semantically into knowledge graphs.",109-116,10.1109/ICSC.2017.85,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a8e864093212caf1ec98c207c55cc21d4dc5775,19,

Our alignment model is based on a novel combination of Convolutional Neural Networks over image regions, bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks over sentences, and a structured objective that aligns the two modalities through a multimodal embedding. We then describe a Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network architecture that uses the inferred alignments to learn to generate novel descriptions of image regions. We demonstrate that our alignment model produces state of the art results in retrieval experiments on Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets.

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features.

SETL builds on Semantic Web (SW) standards and tools and supports developers by offering a number of powerful modules, classes and methods for (dimensional and semantic) DW constructs and tasks. Thus it supports semantic-aware data sources, semantic integration, and creating a semantic DW, composed of an ontology and its instances. A comprehensive experimental evaluation comparing SETL to a solution made with traditional tools (requiring much more hand-coding) on a concrete use case, shows that SETL provides better performance, knowledge base quality and programmer productivity.",29-112,10.1145/2811222.2811229,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/014722151ee576e0361910b31f30902942f6a15a,44,2015-10-22

This Viterbi principle is used in combination with semantic data to improve the accuracy, that is, the environment of the object that is being tracked and a motion model. The starting point is a fingerprinting technique for which an advanced network planner is used to automatically construct the radio map, avoiding a time consuming measurement campaign. The developed algorithm was verified with simulations and with experiments in a building-wide testbed for sensor experiments, where a median accuracy below 2 m was obtained. Compared to a reference algorithm without Viterbi or semantic data, the results indicated a significant improvement: the mean accuracy and standard deviation improved by, respectively, 26.1% and 65.3%.

For example, a biologist and a programmer may use the same query “mouse” with different search context, but the search systems would return same results.

Over the past few years, there has been little progress in object detection techniques. The most efficient are complex computational ensemble methods, which usually combine several low-level image properties with high-level properties. However, every day interest in artificial intelligence is growing, and the idea of using neural networks on board a spacecraft, with the possibility of making decisions and issuing one-time commands, is very promising, since it makes it possible to analyze a large data stream in real time without resorting to ground station, thereby not losing information when transmitting a packet. The purpose of the work is to conduct research on the possibility of effective use of modern models of neural networks, to develop a methodology for their use in the problem of object detection and analysis of the element base for hardware implementation with the possibility of using convolutional neural networks for thermovideotelemetry on board a spacecraft. Results of work. An approach has been formulated that combines two key ideas: 1) application of high-throughput convolutional neural networks for downward processing of image regions in order to localize and segment objects; 2) preliminary training for the auxiliary task, followed by fine tuning of the domain, which gives a significant increase in performance in the case when the training data is insufficient.

Although existing technology is mature enough to integrate a variety of information from heterogeneous sources into interlinked features, it still falls behind when it comes to representation and reasoning on spatial characteristics. It is only lately that several RDF stores have begun to accommodate geospatial entities and to enable some kind of processing on them. To address interoperability, the OGC has recently adopted the GeoSPARQL standard, which defines a vocabulary for representing geometric types in RDF and an extension to the SPARQL language for formulating queries. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in geospatially-enabled semantic data management. Apart from an insightful analysis of the available architectures in industry and academia, we conduct an evaluation study on prominent RDF stores with geospatial support. We also compare their performance and attested capabilities to renowned DBMSs widely used in geospatial applications. We introduce a methodology suitable to assess RDF stores for robustness against large geospatial datasets, and also for expressiveness on a variety of queries involving both spatial and thematic criteria.

The proposed deep structured semantic models are discriminatively trained by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the clicked documents given a query using the clickthrough data. To make our models applicable to large-scale Web search applications, we also use a technique called word hashing, which is shown to effectively scale up our semantic models to handle large vocabularies which are common in such tasks.

However, the success of supervised semantic segmentation typically relies on a large amount of labeled data, which is time-consuming and costly to obtain. Inspired by the success of semi-supervised learning methods for image classification, here we propose a simple yet effective semi-supervised learning framework for semantic segmentation. We demonstrate that the devil is in the details: a set of simple designs and training techniques can collectively improve the performance of semi-supervised semantic segmentation significantly. Previous works [3], [25] fail to effectively employ strong augmentation in pseudo-label learning, as the large distribution disparity caused by strong augmentation harms the batch nor-malization statistics. We design a new batch normalization, namely distribution-specific batch normalization (DSBN) to address this problem and show the importance of strong augmentation for semantic segmentation.

Inspired by recent advance in unsupervised contrastive representation learning, we propose a pixel-wise contrastive algorithm for semantic segmentation in the fully supervised setting. The core idea is to enforce pixel embeddings belonging to a same semantic class to be more similar than embeddings from different classes. It raises a pixel-wise metric learning paradigm for semantic segmentation, by explicitly exploring the structures of labeled pixels, which were rarely explored before. Our method can be effortlessly incorporated into existing segmentation frameworks without extra overhead during testing.

To address this challenging issue, many researchers give attention to unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. Unsupervised domain adaptation seeks to adapt the model trained on the source domain to the target domain. In this paper, we introduce a self-ensembling technique, one of the successful methods for domain adaptation in classification. However, applying self-ensembling to semantic segmentation is very difficult because heavily-tuned manual data augmentation used in self-ensembling is not useful to reduce the large domain gap in the semantic segmentation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework consisting of two components, which are complementary to each other. First, we present a data augmentation method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which is computationally efficient and effective to facilitate domain alignment. Given those augmented images, we apply self-ensembling to enhance the performance of the segmentation network on the target domain.

We find that thermal images produced by thermal imaging cameras are robust to challenging lighting conditions. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel RGB and thermal data fusion network named FuseSeg to achieve superior performance of semantic segmentation in urban scenes.

In this paper, for the first time, we define and solve the problems of semantic search based on conceptual graphs (CGs) over encrypted outsourced data in clouding computing (SSCG). We first employ the efficient measure of “sentence scoring” in text summarization and Tregex to extract the most important and simplified topic sentences from documents. We then convert these simplified sentences into CGs. To perform quantitative calculation of CGs, we design a new method that can map CGs to vectors. Next, we rank the returned results based on “text summarization score”. Furthermore, we propose a basic idea for SSCG and give a significantly improved scheme to satisfy the security guarantee of searchable symmetric encryption (SSE). Finally, we choose a real-world dataset, i.e., the CNN dataset to test our scheme. The results obtained from the experiment show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.",813-823,10.1109/TSC.2016.2622697,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f3fc543fb0ebc7cb51a22823d298e14cc2b222a6,160,2019-09-01

Linked semantic data appears to offer a great potential for exploratory search, which is open-ended, multi-faceted, and iterative in nature. However, there is limited insight into how browsing through linked semantic data sets can support exploratory search. This paper presents a user study with a uni-focal semantic browsing interface for exploratory search through several data sets linked via domain ontologies. The study, which is qualitative and exploratory in nature and uses music as an illustrative domain, examines (i) obstacles and challenges related to user exploratory search in LOD and (ii) the serendipitous learning effect and the role semantics plays in that. The approach and lessons learnt can benefit future human factor studies to evaluate interactive exploration of linked semantic data, as well as technology developers to become aware of issues that have to be addressed in to facilitate exploratory search with LOD.",2,10.1145/2462197.2462199,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e65f148eb5a60ab701dd54931363afbb1cf30eae,21,2013-05-01

Consistency training has proven to be a powerful semi-supervised learning framework for leveraging unlabeled data under the cluster assumption, in which the decision boundary should lie in low-density regions. In this work, we first observe that for semantic segmentation, the low-density regions are more apparent within the hidden representations than within the inputs. We thus propose cross-consistency training, where an invariance of the predictions is enforced over different perturbations applied to the outputs of the encoder. Concretely, a shared encoder and a main decoder are trained in a supervised manner using the available labeled examples. To leverage the unlabeled examples, we enforce a consistency between the main decoder predictions and those of the auxiliary decoders, taking as inputs different perturbed versions of the encoder's output, and consequently, improving the encoder's representations. The proposed method is simple and can easily be extended to use additional training signal, such as image-level labels or pixel-level labels across different domains. We perform an ablation study to tease apart the effectiveness of each component, and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in several datasets.",12671-12681,10.1109/cvpr42600.2020.01269,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/88e8a250f8e28544fe7b74db72ec18a7627ea456,488,2020-03-19

Semantic data integration provides solutions for bridging semantic gaps between common project-level concepts and the local tool concepts used by each discipline. The following use cases represent the foundation for efficient data integration: (a) data insertion in the local tool models, (b) transformation of data between the local models and a common model, and (c) querying across concepts from different local models by using the common model. The selection of a proper semantic data storage for storing the data has a strong impact on efficiently executing these use cases. Three different important types of semantic storages have been identified: ontology file storages, triple storages, and relational databases storages.

In this paper, we introduce data recombination, a novel framework for injecting such prior knowledge into a model. From the training data, we induce a high-precision synchronous context-free grammar, which captures important conditional independence properties commonly found in semantic parsing. We then train a sequence-to-sequence recurrent network (RNN) model with a novel attention-based copying mechanism on datapoints sampled from this grammar, thereby teaching the model about these structural properties. Data recombination improves the accuracy of our RNN model on three semantic parsing datasets, leading to new state-of-the-art performance on the standard GeoQuery dataset for models with comparable supervision.",87-169,10.18653/v1/P16-1002,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b7eac64a8410976759445cce235469163d23ee65,448,2016-06-01

To this end, low-level attributes are selected and used to define a semantic space for texture. 319 texture classes varying in illumination and rotation are positioned within this semantic space using a pair wise relative comparison procedure. Low-level visual features used by existing texture descriptors are then assessed in terms of their correspondence to the semantic space. Textures with strong presence of attributes connoting randomness and complexity are shown to be poorly modelled by existing descriptors. In a retrieval experiment semantic descriptors are shown to outperform visual descriptors. Semantic modelling of texture is thus shown to provide considerable value in both feature selection and in analysis tasks.",1248-1255,10.1109/CVPR.2013.165,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6cfe02d90260640a151a2cd172b2bf3b000b738,30,2013-06-23

They are unable to assign semantic labels to landmarks observed in the environment. Furthermore, loop closure recognition based on low-level features is often viewpoint-dependent and subject to failure in ambiguous or repetitive environments. On the other hand, object recognition methods can infer landmark classes and scales, resulting in a small set of easily recognizable landmarks, ideal for view-independent unambiguous loop closure. In a map with several objects of the same class, however, a crucial data association problem exists. While data association and recognition are discrete problems usually solved using discrete inference, classical SLAM is a continuous optimization over metric information. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem over sensor states and semantic landmark positions that integrates metric information, semantic information, and data associations, and decompose it into two interconnected problems: an estimation of discrete data association and landmark class probabilities, and a continuous optimization over the metric states. The estimated landmark and robot poses affect the association and class distributions, which in turn affect the robot-landmark pose optimization.

Recent revolutionary results of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) foreshadow the advent of reliable classifiers to perform such visual tasks. However, DCNNs require learning of many parameters from raw images, thus, having a sufficient amount of diverse images with class annotations is needed. These annotations are obtained via cumbersome, human labour which is particularly challenging for semantic segmentation since pixel-level annotations are required. In this paper, we propose to use a virtual world to automatically generate realistic synthetic images with pixel-level annotations. Then, we address the question of how useful such data can be for semantic segmentation - in particular, when using a DCNN paradigm. In order to answer this question we have generated a synthetic collection of diverse urban images, named SYNTHIA, with automatically generated class annotations. We use SYNTHIA in combination with publicly available real-world urban images with manually provided annotations. Then, we conduct experiments with DCNNs that show how the inclusion of SYNTHIA in the training stage significantly improves performance on the semantic segmentation task.",3234-3243,10.1109/CVPR.2016.352,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9358d2ae944cfbdcb4b48e2e0c5f7ad97118b74e,1897,2016-06-27

However, these approaches heavily rely on annotated data which are labor intensive. To cope with this limitation, automatically annotated data generated from graphic engines are used to train segmentation models. However, the models trained from synthetic data are difficult to transfer to real images. To tackle this issue, previous works have considered directly adapting models from the source data to the unlabeled target data (to reduce the inter-domain gap). Nonetheless, these techniques do not consider the large distribution gap among the target data itself (intra-domain gap). In this work, we propose a two-step self-supervised domain adaptation approach to minimize the inter-domain and intra-domain gap together. First, we conduct the inter-domain adaptation of the model, from this adaptation, we separate target domain into an easy and hard split using an entropy-based ranking function. Finally, to decrease the intra-domain gap, we propose to employ a self-supervised adaptation technique from the easy to the hard subdomain.

Meanwhile, adversarial training is applied on the joint output space to preserve the correlation between semantics and depth.

Second, the spaces are parsed into their structural and building elements (e.g. walls, columns, etc). Performing these with a strong notation of global 3D space is the backbone of our method. The alignment in the first step injects strong 3D priors from the canonical coordinate system into the second step for discovering elements. This allows diverse challenging scenarios as man-made indoor spaces often show recurrent geometric patterns while the appearance features can change drastically. We also argue that identification of structural elements in indoor spaces is essentially a detection problem, rather than segmentation which is commonly used.

Our approach can accurately perform full semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds at sensor frame rate. We exploit range images as an intermediate representation in combination with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) exploiting the rotating LiDAR sensor model. To obtain accurate results, we propose a novel post-processing algorithm that deals with problems arising from this intermediate representation such as discretization errors and blurry CNN outputs. We implemented and thoroughly evaluated our approach including several comparisons to the state of the art. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, while still running online on a single embedded GPU.

The problem takes many forms; learning vocabulary from text is an especially dramatic and convenient case for research. A new general theory of acquired similarity and knowledge representation, latent semantic analysis (LSA), is presented and used to successfully simulate such learning and several other psycholinguistic phenomena. By inducing global knowledge indirectly from local co-occurrence data in a large body of representative text, LSA acquired knowledge about the full vocabulary of English at a comparable rate to schoolchildren. LSA uses no prior linguistic or perceptual similarity knowledge; it is based solely on a general mathematical learning method that achieves powerful inductive effects by extracting the right number of dimensions (e.g., 300) to represent objects and contexts. Relations to other theories, phenomena, and problems are sketched.",211-240,10.1037/0033-295X.104.2.211,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/68dd4b89ce1407372a29d05ca9e4e1a2e0513617,6289,1997-04-01

We investigate the challenging problem of domain generalization, i.e., training a model on multi-domain source data such that it can directly generalize to target domains with unknown statistics. We adopt a model-agnostic learning paradigm with gradient-based meta-train and meta-test procedures to expose the optimization to domain shift. Further, we introduce two complementary losses which explicitly regularize the semantic structure of the feature space. Globally, we align a derived soft confusion matrix to preserve general knowledge of inter-class relationships. Locally, we promote domain-independent class-specific cohesion and separation of sample features with a metric-learning component. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with new state-of-the-art results on two common object recognition benchmarks. Our method also shows consistent improvement on a medical image segmentation task.",6447-6458,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9f93e2de4c24acd3ffb10efae1c849a63830148d,552,2019-10-29

However, the semantic heterogeneity of geospatial data is a major problem that significantly hinders geospatial data integration and sharing. Ontologies are regarded as a promising way to solve semantic problems by providing a formalized representation of geographic entities and relationships between them in a manner understandable to machines. Thus, many efforts have been made to explore ontology-based geospatial data integration and sharing. However, there is a lack of a specialized ontology that would provide a unified description for geospatial data. In this paper, with a focus on the characteristics of geospatial data, we propose a unified framework for geospatial data ontology, denoted GeoDataOnt, to establish a semantic foundation for geospatial data integration and sharing. First, we provide a characteristics hierarchy of geospatial data. Next, we analyze the semantic problems for each characteristic of geospatial data. Subsequently, we propose the general framework of GeoDataOnt, targeting these problems according to the characteristics of geospatial data. GeoDataOnt is then divided into multiple modules, and we show a detailed design and implementation for each module. Key limitations and challenges of GeoDataOnt are identified, and broad applications of GeoDataOnt are discussed.",269 - 296,10.1080/20964471.2019.1661662,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d0e25741c5f840a5783e3536cf732a8415697112,35,2019-07-03

Current architectures of GCNs are limited to the small receptive field of convolution filters and shared transformation matrix for each node. To address these limitations, we propose Semantic Graph Convolutional Networks (SemGCN), a novel neural network architecture that operates on regression tasks with graph-structured data. SemGCN learns to capture semantic information such as local and global node relationships, which is not explicitly represented in the graph. These semantic relationships can be learned through end-to-end training from the ground truth without additional supervision or hand-crafted rules. We further investigate applying SemGCN to 3D human pose regression. Our formulation is intuitive and sufficient since both 2D and 3D human poses can be represented as a structured graph encoding the relationships between joints in the skeleton of a human body. We carry out comprehensive studies to validate our method. The results prove that SemGCN outperforms state of the art while using 90% fewer parameters.",3420-3430,10.1109/CVPR.2019.00354,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27ff37bd17a5e59149e645184ed4a0c2fb9cf2f2,411,2019-04-06

The goal in semantic parsing is to generate a structured meaning representation given a natural language input. However, language models are trained to generate natural language. To bridge the gap, we use language models to paraphrase inputs into a controlled sublanguage resembling English that can be automatically mapped to a target meaning representation. Our results demonstrate that with only a small amount of data and very little code to convert into English-like representations, our blueprint for rapidly bootstrapping semantic parsers leads to surprisingly effective performance on multiple community tasks, greatly exceeding baseline methods also trained on the same limited data.",56-173,10.18653/v1/2021.emnlp-main.608,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64a1dbdd7653eaca25c78e87335ee156b6f6959e,148,2021-04-18

The underlying idea is that the aggregate of all the word contexts in which a given word does and does not appear provides a set of mutual constraints that largely determines the similarity of meaning of words and sets of words to each other. The adequacy of LSA's reflection of human knowledge has been established in a variety of ways. For example, its scores overlap those of humans on standard vocabulary and subject matter tests; it mimics human word sorting and category judgments; it simulates word‐word and passage‐word lexical priming data; and, as reported in 3 following articles in this issue, it accurately estimates passage coherence, learnability of passages by individual students, and the quality and quantity of knowledge contained in an essay.",259-284,10.1080/01638539809545028,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/582259e5d9cc29eb0148d6232c5579241f2c4f43,5134,

Existing memory mappingguided techniques do not work in that scenario as pointers in the un-mappable memory cannot be resolved and navigated. To address this problem, we present a probabilistic inference-based approach called DIMSUM to enable the recognition of data structure instances from un-mappable memory. Given a set of memory pages and the specification of a target data structure, DIMSUM will identify instances of the data structure in those pages with quantifiable confidence. More specifically, it builds graphical models based on boolean constraints generated from the data structure and the memory page contents. Probabilistic inference is performed on the graphical models to generate results ranked with probabilities. Our experiments with realworld applications on both Linux and Android platforms show that DIMSUM achieves higher effectiveness than nonprobabilistic approaches without memory mapping information.",65-138,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f64e1106e93928a4f49071f20d80d4a18d184c1d,34,

Building on existing two-branch methods for fast segmentation, we introduce our `learning to downsample' module which computes low-level features for multiple resolution branches simultaneously. Our network combines spatial detail at high resolution with deep features extracted at lower resolution, yielding an accuracy of 68.0% mean intersection over union at 123.5 frames per second on Cityscapes.

The main challenge in the big EO analysis domain is producing information from EO data, because numerical, sensory data have no semantic meaning; they lack semantics. We are introducing the concept of a semantic EO data cube as an advancement of state-of-the-art EO data cubes. We define a semantic EO data cube as a spatio-temporal data cube containing EO data, where for each observation at least one nominal (i.e., categorical) interpretation is available and can be queried in the same instance. Here we clarify and share our definition of semantic EO data cubes, demonstrating how they enable different possibilities for data retrieval, semantic queries based on EO data content and semantically enabled analysis. Semantic EO data cubes are the foundation for EO data expert systems, where new information can be inferred automatically in a machine-based way using semantic queries that humans understand. We argue that semantic EO data cubes are better positioned to handle current and upcoming big EO data challenges than non-semantic EO data cubes, while facilitating an ever-diversifying user-base to produce their own information and harness the immense potential of big EO data.",102,10.3390/DATA4030102,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b1e79800ff36c1708d350e019641f423be78b494,29,2019-07-17

2b1fbf14de0381a48c736e625fbb1329d71c798c,Semantic Autoencoder for Zero-Shot Learning,"Existing zero-shot learning (ZSL) models typically learn a projection function from a feature space to a semantic embedding space (e.g. attribute space). However, such a projection function is only concerned with predicting the training seen class semantic representation (e.g. attribute prediction) or classification. When applied to test data, which in the context of ZSL contains different (unseen) classes without training data, a ZSL model typically suffers from the project domain shift problem. In this work, we present a novel solution to ZSL based on learning a Semantic AutoEncoder (SAE). Taking the encoder-decoder paradigm, an encoder aims to project a visual feature vector into the semantic space as in the existing ZSL models. However, the decoder exerts an additional constraint, that is, the projection/code must be able to reconstruct the original visual feature. We show that with this additional reconstruction constraint, the learned projection function from the seen classes is able to generalise better to the new unseen classes. Importantly, the encoder and decoder are linear and symmetric which enable us to develop an extremely efficient learning algorithm. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAE outperforms significantly the existing ZSL models with the additional benefit of lower computational cost. Furthermore, when the SAE is applied to supervised clustering problem, it also beats the state-of-the-art.",4447-4456,10.1109/CVPR.2017.473,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b1fbf14de0381a48c736e625fbb1329d71c798c,762,2017-04-26

Building families on reference proteomes sequences brings greater stability, which decreases the amount of manual curation required to maintain them. It also reduces the number of sequences displayed on the website, whilst still providing access to many important model organisms. Matches to the full UniProtKB database are, however, still available and Pfam annotations for individual UniProtKB sequences can still be retrieved.

Genomic properties, such as genome size and DNA G+C content, and the occurrence in human microbiome data were calculated for each genus or higher taxa.

The RefSeq project augments these reference sequences with current knowledge including publications, functional features and informative nomenclature. The database currently represents sequences from more than 55 000 organisms (>4800 viruses, >40 000 prokaryotes and >10 000 eukaryotes; RefSeq release 71), ranging from a single record to complete genomes. This paper summarizes the current status of the viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic branches of the RefSeq project, reports on improvements to data access and details efforts to further expand the taxonomic representation of the collection. We also highlight diverse functional curation initiatives that support multiple uses of RefSeq data including taxonomic validation, genome annotation, comparative genomics, and clinical testing.

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.",248-255,10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d2c733e34d48784a37d717fe43d9e93277a8c53e,51039,2009-06-20
02613d6e3ecf67ed9ae8ce67a35a92f3986bc4cf,Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs.,"The BLAST programs are widely used tools for searching protein and DNA databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.","

New additions have been coupled with efforts to improve existing families, including refinement of domain boundaries, their classification into Pfam clans, as well as their functional annotation. We recently began to collaborate with the RepeatsDB resource to improve the definition of tandem repeat families within Pfam. We carried out a significant comparison to the structural classification database, namely the Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains (ECOD) that led to the creation of 825 new families based on their set of uncharacterized families (EUFs). Furthermore, we also connected Pfam entries to the Sequence Ontology (SO) through mapping of the Pfam type definitions to SO terms. Since Pfam has many community contributors, we recently enabled the linking between authorship of all Pfam entries with the corresponding authors’ ORCID identifiers.

Since its creation, MSigDB has grown beyond its roots in metabolic disease and cancer to include >10,000 gene sets. These better represent a wider range of biological processes and diseases, but the utility of the database is reduced by increased redundancy across, and heterogeneity within, gene sets. To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of ""hallmark"" gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a ""refined"" gene set, derived from multiple ""founder"" sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.","

WordNet: An Electronic Lexical Database, edited by Christiane Fellbaum, discusses the design of WordNet from both theoretical and historical perspectives, provides an up-to-date description of the lexical database, and presents a set of applications of WordNet. The book contains a foreword by George Miller, an introduction by Christiane Fellbaum, seven chapters from the Cognitive Sciences Laboratory of Princeton University, where WordNet was produced, and nine chapters contributed by scientists from elsewhere. Miller's foreword offers a fascinating account of the history of WordNet. He discusses the presuppositions of such a lexical database, how the top-level noun categories were determined, and the sources of the words in WordNet. He also writes about the evolution of WordNet from its original incarnation as a dictionary browser to a broad-coverage lexicon, and the involvement of different people during its various stages of development over a decade. It makes very interesting reading for casual and serious users of WordNet and anyone who is grateful for the existence of WordNet. The book is organized in three parts. Part I is about WordNet itself and consists of four chapters: ""Nouns in WordNet"" by George Miller, ""Modifiers in WordNet"" by Katherine Miller, ""A semantic network of English verbs"" by Christiane Fellbaum, and ""Design and implementation of the WordNet lexical database and search software"" by Randee Tengi. These chapters are essentially updated versions of four papers from Miller (1990). Compared with the earlier papers, the chapters in this book focus more on the underlying assumptions and rationales behind the design decisions. The description of the information contained in WordNet, however, is not as detailed as in Miller (1990). The main new additions in these chapters include an explanation of sense grouping in George Miller's chapter, a section about adverbs in Katherine Miller's chapter, observations about autohyponymy (one sense of a word being a hyponym of another sense of the same word) and autoantonymy (one sense of a word being an antonym of another sense of the same word) in Fellbaum's chapter, and Tengi's description of the Grinder, a program that converts the files the lexicographers work with to searchable lexical databases.

The 16S rRNA gene has been used extensively for this task when coupled with a well-curated database, such as EzTaxon, containing sequences of type strains of prokaryotic species with validly published names. Although the EzTaxon database has been widely used for routine identification of prokaryotic isolates, sequences from uncultured prokaryotes have not been considered. Here, the next generation database, named EzTaxon-e, is formally introduced. This new database covers not only species within the formal nomenclatural system but also phylotypes that may represent species in nature. In addition to an identification function based on Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (blast) searches and pairwise global sequence alignments, a new objective method of assessing the degree of completeness in sequencing is proposed. All sequences that are held in the EzTaxon-e database have been subjected to phylogenetic analysis and this has resulted in a complete hierarchical classification system. It is concluded that the EzTaxon-e database provides a useful taxonomic backbone for the identification of cultured and uncultured prokaryotes and offers a valuable means of communication among microbiologists who routinely encounter taxonomically novel isolates.

Current action recognition databases contain on the order of ten different action categories collected under fairly controlled conditions. State-of-the-art performance on these datasets is now near ceiling and thus there is a need for the design and creation of new benchmarks. To address this issue we collected the largest action video database to-date with 51 action categories, which in total contain around 7,000 manually annotated clips extracted from a variety of sources ranging from digitized movies to YouTube. We use this database to evaluate the performance of two representative computer vision systems for action recognition and explore the robustness of these methods under various conditions such as camera motion, viewpoint, video quality and occlusion.",2556-2563,10.1109/ICCV.2011.6126543,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b3b8848a311c501e704c45c6d50430ab7068956,3327,2011-11-06

InterProScan is the underlying software that allows protein and nucleic acid sequences to be searched against InterPro's signatures. Signatures are predictive models which describe protein families, domains or sites, and are provided by multiple databases. InterPro combines signatures representing equivalent families, domains or sites, and provides additional information such as descriptions, literature references and Gene Ontology (GO) terms, to produce a comprehensive resource for protein classification. Founded in 1999, InterPro has become one of the most widely used resources for protein family annotation. Here, we report the status of InterPro (version 81.0) in its 20th year of operation, and its associated software, including updates to database content, the release of a new website and REST API, and performance improvements in InterProScan.",D344 - D354,10.1093/nar/gkaa977,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/317325439a0ce543d7629848a35adea04b6e7d12,1191,2020-11-06

CARD focuses on providing high-quality reference data and molecular sequences within a controlled vocabulary, the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), designed by the CARD biocuration team to integrate with software development efforts for resistome analysis and prediction, such as CARD’s Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) software. Since 2017, CARD has expanded through extensive curation of reference sequences, revision of the ontological structure, curation of over 500 new AMR detection models, development of a new classification paradigm and expansion of analytical tools. Most notably, a new Resistomes & Variants module provides analysis and statistical summary of in silico predicted resistance variants from 82 pathogens and over 100 000 genomes. By adding these resistance variants to CARD, we are able to summarize predicted resistance using the information included in CARD, identify trends in AMR mobility and determine previously undescribed and novel resistance variants.

The database includes six climate elements and extends over the global land surface. The database is checked for inhomogeneities in the station records using an automated method that refines previous methods by using incomplete and partially overlapping records and by detecting inhomogeneities with opposite signs in different seasons. The method includes the development of reference series using neighbouring stations. Information from different sources about a single station may be combined, even without an overlapping period, using a reference series. Thus, a longer station record may be obtained and fragmentation of records reduced.

Employing the expectation maximization algorithm, the analysis learns to distinguish correct from incorrect database search results, computing probabilities that peptide assignments to spectra are correct based upon database search scores and the number of tryptic termini of peptides. Using SEQUEST search results for spectra generated from a sample of known protein components, we demonstrate that the computed probabilities are accurate and have high power to discriminate between correctly and incorrectly assigned peptides. This analysis makes it possible to filter large volumes of MS/MS database search results with predictable false identification error rates and can serve as a common standard by which the results of different research groups are compared.","

First described in 2007, the HMDB is now considered the standard metabolomic resource for human metabolic studies. Over the past decade the HMDB has continued to grow and evolve in response to emerging needs for metabolomics researchers and continuing changes in web standards. This year's update, HMDB 4.0, represents the most significant upgrade to the database in its history. For instance, the number of fully annotated metabolites has increased by nearly threefold, the number of experimental spectra has grown by almost fourfold and the number of illustrated metabolic pathways has grown by a factor of almost 60. Significant improvements have also been made to the HMDB’s chemical taxonomy, chemical ontology, spectral viewing, and spectral/text searching tools. A great deal of brand new data has also been added to HMDB 4.0. This includes large quantities of predicted MS/MS and GC–MS reference spectral data as well as predicted (physiologically feasible) metabolite structures to facilitate novel metabolite identification. Additional information on metabolite-SNP interactions and the influence of drugs on metabolite levels (pharmacometabolomics) has also been added. Many other important improvements in the content, the interface, and the performance of the HMDB website have been made and these should greatly enhance its ease of use and its potential applications in nutrition, biochemistry, clinical chemistry, clinical genetics, medicine, and metabolomics science.",D608 - D617,10.1093/nar/gkx1089,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80777d42513103bede188b2eebbdce7fb6f91390,2571,2017-11-11

Toward this goal, remarkable progress has been made in recent years, both in terms of experimental measurements and computational prediction techniques. However, public efforts to collect and present protein interaction information have struggled to keep up with the pace of interaction discovery, partly because protein–protein interaction information can be error-prone and require considerable effort to annotate. Here, we present an update on the online database resource Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING); it provides uniquely comprehensive coverage and ease of access to both experimental as well as predicted interaction information. Interactions in STRING are provided with a confidence score, and accessory information such as protein domains and 3D structures is made available, all within a stable and consistent identifier space. New features in STRING include an interactive network viewer that can cluster networks on demand, updated on-screen previews of structural information including homology models, extensive data updates and strongly improved connectivity and integration with third-party resources.

ECA rules are completely supported through the ECA Agent without changing applications in the SQL Server. Both primitive and composite events can be detected in the ECA Agent and actions are invoked in SQL Server. All events are persistent in RDBMS. The Java Local Event Detector (Java LED) is used to notify and detect both primitive events and composite events. The ECA Agent uses Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) to connect to the SQL server. The architecture of the ECA Agent and implementation details are shown in this thesis. Alternative approaches are discussed in details, and the features and limitations are identified.

Flexible and Efficient Information Handling This book is the proceedings of a workshop held at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh in August 1993. The central theme of the workshop was rules in database systems, and the papers presented covered a range of different aspects of database rule systems. These aspects are reflected in the sessions of the workshop, which are the same as the sections in this proceedings: Active Databases Architectures Incorporating Temporal Rules Rules and Transactions Analysis and Debugging of Active Rules Integrating Graphs/Objects with Deduction Integrating Deductive and Active Rules Integrity Constraints Deductive Databases The incorporation of rules into database systems is an important area of research, as it is a major component in the integration of behavioural information with the structural data with which commercial databases have traditionally been associated. This integration of the behavioural aspects of an application with the data to which it applies in database systems leads to more straightforward application development and more efficient processing of data. Many novel applications seem to need database systems in which structural and behavioural information are fully integrated. Rules are only one means of expressing behavioural information, but it is clear that different types of rule can be used to capture directly different properties of an application which are cumbersome to support using conventional database architectures. In recent years there has been a surge of research activity focusing upon active database systems, and this volume opens with a collection of papers devoted specifically to this topic. Web Information Systems -WISE 2004 Active database systems enhance traditional database functionality with powerful rule-processing capabilities, providing a uniform and efficient mechanism for many database system applications. Among these applications are integrity constraints, views, authorization, statistics gathering, monitoring and alerting, knowledge-based systems, expert systems, and workflow management. This significant collection focuses on the most prominent research projects in active database systems. The project leaders for each Page 4/14 Online Library Active Database Systems Triggers And Rules For Advanced Database Processing The Morgan Kaufmann Series In Data Management Systems prototype system provide detailed discussion of their projects and the relevance of their results to the future of active database systems. Features: A broad overview of current active database systems and how they can be extended and improved A comprehensive introduction to the core topics of the field, including its motivation and history Coverage of active database (trigger) capabilities in commercial products Discussion of forthcoming standards Knowledge-Based Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems Knowledge Base Systems are an integration of conventional database systems with Artificial Intelligence techniques. They provide inference capabilities to the database system by encapsulating the knowledge of the application domain within the database. Knowledge is the most valuable of all corporate resources that must be captured, stored, re-used and continuously improved, in much the same way as database systems were important in the previous decade. Flexible, extensible, and yet efficient Knowledge Base Systems are needed to capture the increasing demand for knowledge-based applications which will become a significant market in the next decade. Knowledge can be expressed in many static and dynamic forms; the most prominent being domain objects, their relationships, and their rules of evolution and transformation. It is important to express and seamlessly use all types of knowledge in a single Knowledge Base System. Parallel, Object-Oriented, and Active Knowledge Base Systems presents in detail features that a Knowledge Base System should have in order to fulfill the above requirements. Parallel, Object-Oriented, and Active Knowledge Base Systems covers in detail the following topics: Integration of deductive, production, and active rules in sequential database systems. Integration and inter-operation of multiple rule types into the same Knowledge Base System. Parallel rule matching and execution, for deductive, production, and active rules, in parallel Export, Knowledge Base, and Database Systems. In-depth description of a Parallel, Object-Oriented, and Active Knowledge Base System that integrates all rule paradigms into a single database system without hindering performance. Parallel, Object-Oriented, and Active Knowledge Base Systems is intended as a graduate-level text for a course on Knowledge Base Systems and as a reference for researchers and practitioners in the areas of database systems, knowledge base systems and Artificial Intelligence. Active, Real-Time, and Temporal Database Systems The World Wide Web has become a ubiquitous global tool, used for finding infor mation, communicating ideas, carrying out distributed computation and conducting business, learning and science. The Web is highly dynamic in both the content and quantity of the information that it encompasses. In order to fully exploit its enormous potential as a global repository of information, we need to understand how its size, topology and content are evolv ing. This then allows the development of new techniques for locating and retrieving information that are better able to adapt and scale to its change and growth. The Web's users are highly diverse and can access the Web from a variety of devices and interfaces, at different places and times, and for varying purposes. We thus also need techniques for personalising the presentation and content of Page 5/14 Online Library Active Database Systems Triggers And Rules For Advanced Database Processing The Morgan Kaufmann Series In Data Management Systems Web based information dependi g on how it i being accessed and on the specific user's requirements. As well as being accessed by human users, the Web is also accessed by appli cations. New applications in areas such as ebusiness, sensor networks, and mobile and ubiquitous computing need to be able to detect and react quickly to events and changes in Web-based information. Traditional approaches using query-based 'pull' of information to find out if events or changes of interest have occurred may not be able to scale to the quantity and frequency of events and changes being generated, and new 'push' -based techniques are needed.

Thus, accurate prediction of miRNA targets is critical for characterization of miRNA functions. To this end, we have developed an online database, miRDB, for miRNA target prediction and functional annotations. Recently, we have performed major updates for miRDB. Specifically, by employing an improved algorithm for miRNA target prediction, we now present updated transcriptome-wide target prediction data in miRDB, including 3.5 million predicted targets regulated by 7000 miRNAs in five species. Further, we have implemented the new prediction algorithm into a web server, allowing custom target prediction with user-provided sequences. Another new database feature is the prediction of cell-specific miRNA targets. miRDB now hosts the expression profiles of over 1000 cell lines and presents target prediction data that are tailored for specific cell models. At last, a new web query interface has been added to miRDB for prediction of miRNA functions by integrative analysis of target prediction and Gene Ontology data. All data in miRDB are freely accessible at http://mirdb.org.",D127 - D131,10.1093/nar/gkz757,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f53996347086be3bd3a32da0976ba2db7687988,1543,2019-08-31

We continue to improve the Pfam website and add new visualizations, such as the ‘sunburst’ representation of taxonomic distribution of families. In this work we additionally address two topics that will be of particular interest to the Pfam community.

This region is the most polymorphic region of the human genome, and the levels of polymorphism seen exceed most other genes. Some of the genes have several thousand variants and are now termed hyperpolymorphic, rather than just simply polymorphic. The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database has provided a stable, highly accessible, user-friendly repository for this information, providing the scientific and medical community access to the many variant sequences of this gene system, that are critical for the successful outcome of transplantation. The number of currently known variants, and dramatic increase in the number of new variants being identified has necessitated a dedicated resource with custom tools for curation and publication. The challenge for the database is to continue to provide a highly curated database of sequence variants, while supporting the increased number of submissions and complexity of sequences. In order to do this, traditional methods of accessing and presenting data will be challenged, and new methods will need to be utilized to keep pace with new discoveries.",D948 - D955,10.1093/nar/gkz950,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e466ea033b982519f351022304dccb64a46b93c,1512,2019-10-31

Whereas the tremendous recent progress in object recognition tasks is due to the availability of large datasets like ImageNet and the rise of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for learning high-level features, performance at scene recognition has not attained the same level of success. This may be because current deep features trained from ImageNet are not competitive enough for such tasks. Here, we introduce a new scene-centric database called Places with over 7 million labeled pictures of scenes. We propose new methods to compare the density and diversity of image datasets and show that Places is as dense as other scene datasets and has more diversity. Using CNN, we learn deep features for scene recognition tasks, and establish new state-of-the-art results on several scene-centric datasets. A visualization of the CNN layers' responses allows us to show differences in the internal representations of object-centric and scene-centric networks.",487-495,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9667f8264745b626c6173b1310e2ff0298b09cfc,2854,2014-12-08

CDD includes manually curated domain models that make use of protein 3D structure to refine domain models and provide insights into sequence/structure/function relationships. Manually curated models are organized hierarchically if they describe domain families that are clearly related by common descent. As CDD also imports domain family models from a variety of external sources, it is a partially redundant collection. To simplify protein annotation, redundant models and models describing homologous families are clustered into superfamilies. By default, domain footprints are annotated with the corresponding superfamily designation, on top of which specific annotation may indicate high-confidence assignment of family membership. Pre-computed domain annotation is available for proteins in the Entrez/Protein dataset, and a novel interface, Batch CD-Search, allows the computation and download of annotation for large sets of protein queries.

50819fdfb666fdabb12f00e93e0d7e43ba4ba4bd,ZINC - A Free Database of Commercially Available Compounds for Virtual Screening,"A critical barrier to entry into structure-based virtual screening is the lack of a suitable, easy to access database of purchasable compounds. We have therefore prepared a library of 727,842 molecules, each with 3D structure, using catalogs of compounds from vendors (the size of this library continues to grow). The molecules have been assigned biologically relevant protonation states and are annotated with properties such as molecular weight, calculated LogP, and number of rotatable bonds. Each molecule in the library contains vendor and purchasing information and is ready for docking using a number of popular docking programs. Within certain limits, the molecules are prepared in multiple protonation states and multiple tautomeric forms. In one format, multiple conformations are available for the molecules. This database is available for free download (http://zinc.docking.org) in several common file formats including SMILES, mol2, 3D SDF, and DOCK flexibase format. A Web-based query tool incorporating a molecular drawing interface enables the database to be searched and browsed and subsets to be created. Users can process their own molecules by uploading them to a server. Our hope is that this database will bring virtual screening libraries to a wide community of structural biologists and medicinal chemists.","

Since its first release in 2007, the HMDB has been used to facilitate research for nearly 1000 published studies in metabolomics, clinical biochemistry and systems biology. The most recent release of HMDB (version 3.0) has been significantly expanded and enhanced over the 2009 release (version 2.0). In particular, the number of annotated metabolite entries has grown from 6500 to more than 40 000 (a 600% increase). This enormous expansion is a result of the inclusion of both ‘detected’ metabolites (those with measured concentrations or experimental confirmation of their existence) and ‘expected’ metabolites (those for which biochemical pathways are known or human intake/exposure is frequent but the compound has yet to be detected in the body). The latest release also has greatly increased the number of metabolites with biofluid or tissue concentration data, the number of compounds with reference spectra and the number of data fields per entry. In addition to this expansion in data quantity, new database visualization tools and new data content have been added or enhanced. These include better spectral viewing tools, more powerful chemical substructure searches, an improved chemical taxonomy and better, more interactive pathway maps. This article describes these enhancements to the HMDB, which was previously featured in the 2009 NAR Database Issue.

Therefore, elucidating TF–target interactions is a key step toward understanding the regulatory circuitry underlying complex traits such as human diseases. We previously published a reference TF–target interaction database for humans—TRRUST (Transcriptional Regulatory Relationships Unraveled by Sentence-based Text mining)—which was constructed using sentence-based text mining, followed by manual curation. Here, we present TRRUST v2 (www.grnpedia.org/trrust) with a significant improvement from the previous version, including a significantly increased size of the database consisting of 8444 regulatory interactions for 800 TFs in humans. More importantly, TRRUST v2 also contains a database for TF–target interactions in mice, including 6552 TF–target interactions for 828 mouse TFs. TRRUST v2 is also substantially more comprehensive and less biased than other TF–target interaction databases. We also improved the web interface, which now enables prioritization of key TFs for a physiological condition depicted by a set of user-input transcriptional responsive genes. With the significant expansion in the database size and inclusion of the new web tool for TF prioritization, we believe that TRRUST v2 will be a versatile database for the study of the transcriptional regulation involved in human diseases.",D380 - D386,10.1093/nar/gkx1013,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba90ae48b30594b57a5ca7bfd37cae150458ecfa,1137,2017-10-26

The hierarchical classification is: protein-species, family, clan, with an identifier at each level. The MEROPS website moved to the EMBL-EBI in 2017, requiring refactoring of the code-base and services provided. The interface to sequence searching has changed and the MEROPS protein sequence libraries can be searched at the EMBL-EBI with HMMER, FastA and BLASTP. Cross-references have been established between MEROPS and the PANTHER database at both the family and protein-species level, which will help to improve curation and coverage between the resources. Because of the increasing size of the MEROPS sequence collection, in future only sequences of characterized proteins, and from completely sequenced genomes of organisms of evolutionary, medical or commercial significance will be added. As an example, peptidase homologues in four proteomes from the Asgard superphylum of Archaea have been identified and compared to other archaean, bacterial and eukaryote proteomes. This has given insights into the origins and evolution of peptidase families, including an expansion in the number of proteasome components in Asgard archaeotes and as organisms increase in complexity.
